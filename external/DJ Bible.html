    Kill that desperation! 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Being a Don Juan is not a net sum of smooth manuevers and methods but of your own outlook on the world and on women. ANYONE can memorize 'techniques', but FEW can change the way HOW they think. Women will be able to sniff out the former. But with the latter, women will be clawing each other for you.A Don Juan is a state of mind, not a list of methods and tricks.This must be stated because it brings us to the subject of 'desperation'.In the end, we are all desperate with desire. We wouldn't be looking for tips and answers if we did not desire a girlfriend or MULTIPLE girlfriends (being a bit ambitious, aren't we?  ). We all want a woman (or women  ), but our desire and feelings brings out the desperation traits within us.Where I work, I ask the women why they found a co-worker to be so desperate. Here are some of their answers:-always giving the women attention.-calling all the time (and calling immediately once getting the number, immediately returning a call, etc.)-taking every opportunity to talk to them (and telling everything about yourself)-always available.-NEVER willing to walk away (NEVER willing to disagree, ALWAYS supplicating).-etc.What theme can we find in the above? It is that the man puts the woman on the pedestal rather then himself.Imagine if a woman did all of the above to you. Imagine if a woman was OBSESSED with you, always calling you, always available, and always spending her free time FOR YOU. Any interest you had for this woman would soon evaporate. Why? Because in your own mind you are thinking two things: "No one else must want her," AND "If I can get her OBSESSED about me, I know I can get BETTER girls to be interested in me." Her desperation is turning you off. The same is true for women.Women are not attracted to desperate men. Period. I've told my co-worker this and his response: "Well, that is just who I am." Eventually, he will realize that the only common denominator in his pattern of crash and burns will be HIM. So if anyone has told you that you're desperate, consider that its true.There is a KEY to removing desperation forever. There is no simple 'trick' that will kill the desperation. It will not be in how you dress, how you talk, or where you go for dates. No, the KEY is in how you think.The KEY to killing desperation (and attracting crowds of women) is to THINK and BELIEVE that you are The Great Catch.Desperate guys do not do this. They see the woman as the prize rather then themselves. They see that the woman must be 'wooed' rather then them. They will, thus, supplicate and become a 'nice guy'. (And nice guys finish LAST.)If you start treating a woman like precious gold, she will believe she is gold. And once she believes it, she will DUMP YOU because YOU have given her the sense that she is BETTER then you. Once she thinks that, she will want to REPLACE YOU with someone better, because you have given her reasons to believe that YOU ARE UNWORTHY OF HER GREATNESS.After all, if we think we can ****** someone better, we will. This holds true for both men and women. The last thing we want is to settle for a mate when we could have gotten better. (This is why the element of challenge is so important in the Dating Game.)The lesson: DON'T GIVE HER A REASON TO THINK SHE IS BETTER. You are the gold; she should be thrilled just to have A CHANCE with you.The first step in becoming the Prince Charming every woman dreams of is to THINK OF YOURSELF AS A PRINCE.When you BELIEVE you are that prince, that you are The Great Catch, all the 'desperation' signs you were emitting vanish and an aura of attraction will surround you. Combine this manner of thinking with all the Don Juan skills you know, and you will become irresistable.Let us look at the desperation signs again:-always giving the women attention.Now that you're The Prince, you don't have time to give women attention. A Prince is kind, ENTHUSIASTIC, smiling, yet YOU have things to do. A Prince's time is precious. A woman must win your attention; you shall not give it to them.-calling all the time (and calling immediately once getting the number, immediately returning a call, etc.)The Great Catch simply CANNOT call all the time because he has tons of other numbers. The Great Catch is not competing for a particular girl. The girls, rather, are competing for him.-taking every opportunity to talk to them (and telling everything about yourself)Why would Prince Charming tell everything about himself to a woman? No, the woman must JUSTIFY HERSELF to him because YOU ARE THE GOODS. The Prince would reveal things about himself only as a reward. The woman loves the mystery in this and sees knowing the Prince as peeling layers of an onion, knowing him GRADUALLY.-always available.The Great Catch is busy with many many women! She must fight for your time, NOT the other way around.-NEVER willing to walk away (NEVER willing to disagree, ALWAYS supplicating).Prince Charming wouldn't accept ANY disrespect from any woman. If a woman gave him such disrespect, he WALKS AWAY. The Prince KNOWS all these women want to be with him so he can eject at any time.Now, I know what you're thinking, "Pook, I can't act like a Prince Charming or The Great Catch. I DON'T have tons of women after me." This is reversing CAUSE and EFFECT. ASSUME you are the Great Catch, THINK that you are, and as you think you shall become. It becomes a self-fullfilling prophecy. Treat your hobbies as if they have more value then the women do (or treat your hobbies as if they WERE other women). When you think you are the Great Catch, you will act like it and the women will KNOW that you are.Women love certain traits in guys. By THINKING you are The Great Catch allows you to emit these traits NATURALLY and without any effort.-Good looksYou cannot change your genes. But you can change the way how you treat those genes. Does Prince Charming wear raggedy T-shirts? Does the Great Catch walk with his head down? NO! You will wear nice clothes and walk with pride BECAUSE you are proud of yourself. After all, you ARE one of the best. So treat yourself accordingly.Anyone can wear a suit. But few can wear a suit proudly. Few can wear a suit that seems to fit them naturally and creates an aura of importance. Good carriage, excellent threads, are the CONSEQUENCE by how you think of yourself. Women know this and is the reason why you are judged by this criteria.-HumorGirls LOVE humor. Prince Charming and the Great Catch are funny because they know that they, themselves, are fun. They don't worry, "My goodness, she is really cute! How can I attract her!?" They ASSUME she will be attracted and they have fun in the meantime.Don't be shy. Let your personality SHINE. When you think you are the Great Catch, this should come more naturally because you have nothing to fear.-DominanceYou are THE MAN. You must be IN CHARGE. Desperate guys will try to be 'nice' in every which way to win the girl (and fail, of course). But Prince Charming and the Great Catch will SWEEP WOMEN OFF THEIR FEET. When you THINK you are the goods, you realize that it is ridiculous to treat a relationship and flirting as walking on eggshells. YOU set the rules, NOT the other way around. After all, YOU are the prize to be sought.Look at the soap operas and romance novels for grounds of this. Women like to be in the presence of a MAN, not a boy, not a chump, and certainly not a 'nice guy'.Dominance is also being sure of yourself. Do not speak in a soft tone. Speak STRONGLY and behave STRONGLY. After all, do you think Prince Charming worries about making mistakes? No, so neither should you.I know, I know. I can hear you saying, "But I must worry about mistakes or else I'll have another 'learning experience' on my hands."This is a GOOD THING. Let us say that, in a normal conversation, you came across a word you did not know how to pronounce. Most people will utter the word softly for fear of criticism. This is stupid. Say the word LOUD! Let me repeat, say the word LOUD! If you are wrong, you will be corrected. Clearing up mistakes is ALWAYS a good thing and should NEVER be feared.The same applies with dating. Do not date with hesitation and shyness; date with all conviction. Remember, the biggest risk you can take in life is not to take any risks at all.-AmbitionWhen you think yourself as The Great Catch, you KNOW women are not the priority of your life. After all, the Great Catch knows he can get any woman whenever he wants. When you feel good about life, you cease to fear success and demand Life show all that it has. Aim for the moon. If you miss, at least you'll be among the stars.So in the end, too often men think they need a girlfriend to have their life 'complete'. The consequence is that these men will emit signs of desperation. Success is achieved first through the mind, then through the world, never the other way around.------------------Pook"As you think, you shall become."

    <h3>
    A simple and practical guide to an approach 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


In a society such as ours it's assumed that a man has to be the one to approach women.  Unfortunately, even though there are more women in this planet than there are men, women always have more chance with a man than the other way around.  It's   to women's advantage because it was given to them by our society, they get to pick and we constantly line ourselves out in the firing range ready to get shot down.  Those hapless guys are blessed with long lonely nights with nothing else to entertain them but their callused right hand.Knowing this, it should come to no surprise that there are plenty of men who are afraid to approach women.  Add to this the fact that women don't like to be approached and we have a no win situation.  But, fear not gents for I will share some insights I've learned throughout the years.  However you should know first that women do not make you complete and the only person you should always shower with attention is yourself.On to the basics:1. It's you and all youObviously you need a lot confidence to approach women and how you gain this confidence is up to you.  The easy way to gather confidence is to really put more effort onto yourself.  What do I mean by this?  Well, spend time building up the things that make you a unique person.  What makes you stand-out from the rest of the world?  Why would she choose you over millions of other losers out there?  Focus on your strong points and support it at all times.  2. It's all about the groomNo, I don't mean getting married as in bride and groom.  What I mean is give your body the attention it deserves.  Dress up like a decent character and spend time grooming yourself.  Your body be your shrine.  Go to the gym and start putting some effort into staying fit and looking good.  Women really do put more emphasis on looks more than they'd care to admit.  First impressions comes first when she looks at you, so it should be obvious that she is judging you by the way you look.   So pick up your pink leotards and hit the gluteal machine.3. No fear of rejectionThis is the biggest problem for most guys - caused by lack of #1 above.  Just don't take this personally.  We face rejection throughout our lives - rejected from a job offer, parents, school, etc.,  When you're approaching a woman, you're approaching a stranger and she doesn't know you. If she rejects you, don't take it personally. Their could be variable reasons why she would reject you - already committed, don't want to be approached, bad hair day, PMS, and so on.  Don't take it personally, it not a reflection of you but of her mood and your approach.  It's her loss not yours.Things to know before you go:The true experts of the approach is women.  Why? because they've seen it all.  Women get approached by the sleaziest fruicakes out there and are therefore on the defensive.  Knowing this, when you do approach women just know that you are invading their personal space, so show some respect and make it light fellas.  Besides, regardless of how you mask or hide your intentions she already knows what you're after. Some girls are just out to have fun.  Even if they elicit the attention of men, women that are just out with their friends to have fun.  They're out to have a good time and to forget about men in some cases, so more than likely they don't want to be approached - so you have to know when to approach and when not to.Approach, approach, approach:Don't be intimidated by beautiful women.  They eat, crap, and sleep just like you and me.  They have feelings, desires, and problems just like normal people do.  So take them off that pedestal and put them on your level.Approach only when you get the initial eye contact.  If you walk up to her without her noticing you first, you're setting yourself up for the big R.  After the eye contact show her your beautiful smile - when she smiles back that's your que, have at em' Cassanova.Just do it.  Even if you know women hate to get picked up, just do it.  Use humor and confidence to your advantage.  If you say soething funny it will break the ice and get the conversation going.  Don't be serious, she's out to have a good time and so should you.  Be subtle about your approach, talk about light subjects and don't talk about money or your personal problems.  Ask her open ended questions to keep the conversation going.  Don't shower her compliments, if you must give a compliment give a compliment that is not directed to her looks.  Do not make comments about her breast size or hip curves.Don't let a group of women stop you.  If the girl of your dreams is surrounded by her friends approach her anyways.  Get initial eye contact, smile then approach the group.  Introduce yourself to everyone and get take her somewhere where only you two could talk - kindly say: "Excuse me ladies, but could I borrow her for second?".  Take her hand and lead.--And never forget: "What's your home phone number?"Practice, practice, practice:Like I said practice.  Practice talking to complete strangers and gain some social skills - which is very essential to your survival.  Better social skills equals better women.  This is only half the battle of the dating war.  The rest is up to you, but you are given the foundation from which you can  stand on.  Go get em' tiger.[This message has been edited by Adonis (edited 06-22-2001).]

    <h3>
    Be a Man! 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


There is a prize to the person who correctly answers this question, What is a Man? When asked what they want in a guy, women say simply, "A MAN!" But, alas!, real men are becoming more and more rare these days. Women are tired of the sensative wimps who have no backbones. One women even wrote a song about the subject, "Where have all the cowboys gone?"So what is a Man? How should he act? Decades and centuries ago, the question was nonsense. But today in our feminized culture (this may be more in America then in other countries), most of us have been raised to believe that there is something inherently wrong with being a man and acting the way how a man should act. No wonder males don't know how to act around women! No wonder websites like these exist!Indeed, I embarked on this mystery to find out the answer to this question. Several women were bunched up in a group, gossiping and yapping about cute boys, fashion, relationships i.e. nothing. This behavior extends to all women of all cultures (and also different animal species. Cows group together and moo and gnaw on grass and take notice of bulls brave enough to approach the group).I approach. "How are you, ladies!! I am the Pook."A woman squeals. "Oh! It's a Pook!" The others squeal in unison.Once the ladies calm themselves after being in the presence of a Pook, I ask them, "Ladies! Do tell me, what do you define as a Man?"With devilish tongues, the women answer:"A Man is someone sensative to me.""A Man is the guy who will take care of my needs.""A Man is the one that is in tune with my feelings.""A Man is one who doesn't have an ego.""A Man is the guy who will sit and watch chick flicks all day with me.""A Man is the guy who will go shopping with me.""A Man is the guy who will share all his feelings with me."Such are the common answers! The males listen and actualize what the women say. They are constantly declared 'sweet' and 'wonderful' and 'nice', oh 'so nice'. Mothers and older women are proud of them and tell them, "If I were younger, I would go for you!"Poor Nice Guy! The women his own age avoid him like the plague and jump for the jerks. The Nice Guy becomes an emotional tampon to be used and discarded. The Nice Guy, being so nice and sweet, listens to the woman vomit her feelings about men and bleed her problems of her boyfriend on him. He listens with baited hope when he hears, "Oh, why can't guys be like you! You listen and understand." Then she turns around and gets abused by another jerk! The vicious cycle repeats again and again.Why are women acting in this way?They are simply acting as women do, as in their nature. The problem is not with them, it is with guys. We are afraid to embrace OUR nature, that of being a Man. Being in a culture that sees Manhood as predatory and oppressive and uncouth, we cover it up within ourselves. By doing so, we hide our sexuality. (Sexuality! Do I mean rock hard abs and rippling muscles? That is not what women find sexy [it's a contributing factor, not the core]. A type of PERSONALITY is what women are looking for. Someone they can depend on [has backbone], someone who will be successful [has ambition], and someone who is decisive [has charge]. Nice guys have no backbone because they think women are frail things that will break in confrontation; nice guys reveal no ambition because they fear being seen as arrogant to women; nice guys are afraid to be decisive for fear of being seen as 'oppressive'.)Two poles of thought men drift into: the Nice Guy and the Jerk. Both blame the other."You ruin the women with your lack of commitment and unappreciative nature," says the Nice Guy."You spoil the women with your endless listening ear and stupid caring attitude," replies the Jerk.The two endlessly war. Those on the sidelines have their own conclusions. One side says, "The Jerk is the way to go. Ceaseless sex! Evolution demands it." The other side says, "The Nice Guy is the way to go. Glorious relationship! Society demands it."But the two still argue."You cause the women to think they are in control," says the Jerk."Ahh, but you cause the women to think all men are scum," replies the Nice Guy.Is there not an end to the Nice Guy vs.Jerk debate? Are these the only choices?The CycleThe Nice Guy emerges. He is tenderized and wants to shout in every woman's ear "I will not abuse you. I am sweet and good. Based on that alone you should date me." When the Nice Guy talks to the girl on a date, *poof*, the date turns into Oprah. "Oh, my life has been SO downhill from here," the Nice Guy whines. "My little girly car was slashed, I failed my classes, but because of you this day has been so much better." Then the Nice Guy goes, "Let me tell you my life story. My birth was long, hard, and painful for my mother..." Our culture has become so feminized that the Nice Guy thinks it is proper to vomit his feelings and emotions all over the place. (It's gross!) Women, rightfully, run for the hills when they hear your declarations of love.The Metamorphosis comes. The Nice Guy eventually realizes what all the ladies want, becomes bitter, and changes himself into a Jerk. His goal now is to sleep with as many women as possible and figure out all the tricks and tactics to do so. He focuses on calculation rather then natural joy. When a woman comes, he pulls out a chart of all the 'moves' and 'tactics' with arrows and patterns. He unleashes his lap top, accesses a Lay Guide, and reviews his strategy. Time passes and once was fun becomes meaningless.Back to being nice. He sees it now as turning on Nice Guy or turning on Jerk. "Why can't I just be myself!?" he soon thunders at Reality.Just be a Man! There is no need to reprogram yourself. You will have the interests you have, the hobbies you have, the body you have, but you can easily become a MAN. It is all simply in the way how you think and as you think you shall become. But what is Man? Shall we have the answer? Here it is:A Man is a guy who is not scared of his testosterone!A Man follows the passion in his life. Passion of women? Of course not. A Man has goals and desires that goes above that of chasing chicks. After childhood, there are TRUE winners and losers in life. A Man desires to be the winner. A Man WANTS to win in what he does. Because of his passion, a Man can sometimes come off as arrogant and egotistical. He does not apologize for this or for his desires."It is your actions that cause the disgrace of Men," says the Nice Guy."It is yours," replies the Jerk.No, gentlemen, the disgrace of men is in not embracing your true nature: following your passion and, thus, loving life. Women are to enhance your life, not to be your life. So to the Nice Guy, stop placing your happiness on getting a girlfriend. To the Jerk, quit wasting your life on seduction. Don't SPEND your time chasing girls, INVEST it by putting it into your interests and desires, thus the whole of your life.When you do this, all of a sudden you have what every woman wants: Ambition, charge, decisiveness, backbone, kindness, stableness, and confidence.I want you to read what a women posted as what SHE thought was a great guy. (Focus on what I put in BOLD) quote:"Qualifications" of a great guy" 1)PhysicalA bit athletic so he's in shape and a good complexion(If he can help it). Very focused, intelligent eyes which pay attention to whoever deserves it. Hair that can be tossled...and a relaxed, but tidy wardrobe.2)EmotionalHis attitude has gotta be mostly deterministic and level-headed. If crappy stuff happens to him...he should roll with the punches and learn from it. If he ends up doing crappy stuff then he should get up, brush off and be a better guy the next time round. -He must also have deep convictions: he should NEVER give up his ideals or morals for anything. -I know it sounds cheezy, but he must be respectful to his mother(it reflects character)...even if she is witchy like some moms these days. -And of course:sense of humor, artistic, and an awesome boyfriend. 3)SocialA great guy is the one who offers the girls a chair, opens doors etc.(But isn't a total flirt--he just considers it his duty.) -A guy should clean up his language around girls. -He should stand up for people who are being bashed in conversations. That's important to us girls b/c back-stabbing is common among us--and we REALLY notice when somebody isn't a gossip. -Aaaand my personal thing is that he should be the guy who "could" be the center of attention...but he prefers to hang out with the few guys in the back who are his genuine friends. Phew...I hope this helped a bit. Physique: as long as it's within the usual bounds is pretty much unimportant. If you want to get a really great girl...start working on your character and self-control--(not b/c it's you, but b/c those two things are REALLY uncommon these days)--because a great girl is one who's been working on that already and she'll recognize it in you.A Man has character and deep convictions. He has PASSION in life about something. It is this passion that transforms his life, gives him confidence, and gives him joy. It is this PASSION that will give you that right mindset for you have goals and dreams that go beyond chicks.Remember, if you cannot command respect, you cannot attract love. If you cannot be respected, women will ignore you and/or abuse you.Once upon a time, there was a little boy who was scrawny, cried easily, and was a total wuss. At the age of ten, his father looked down at him disapprovingly. "You are such a wimp!" he scolded at his son. The boy cried but eventually discovered what was wrong with him. He worked out, studied, and utilized himself. He went around the world in the most ferocious quests. He became strong and powerful. He entered politics and became an unstoppable force. He would be shot when giving a speech, but he would pull himself back up to continue the speech!He was President Teddy Roosevelt, one of the more significant characters in America. If that little wimpy boy could become such a character, anyone can be a Man.What do guys today do? We try to hide our strength and express our 'femininity'. Take an example of guys: early on in a relationship, they will show how 'great' they are by cooking for the woman!As Anti-Dump said: quote:Real men are not available. They are climbing mountains. They are swimming across rivers. What are YOU doing? Making spagetti?!?!?!A Man,-Does not go through life walking on eggshells.Nice Guys think, "Does she like me? How do I get her to like me?" Good guys think, "Should I like her? Should I go for her?" The Good guy doesn't think about the girl's interest until they're dating. The Good guy looks at all the girls and TAKES what he wants.-Focuses on his dreams.No, this does not include the chick. You must have passion for something in life, something you even want to do for the rest of your life. Your romantic life is an echo of your regular life.-Does not apologize for his testosterone, for his desires."Oh, I am so sorry, ladies! I am afflicted with this disease known as M.A.L.E. It is natural for me to glance at you, your oh so curvaceous body. I am soooo sorry. Please, please FORGIVE ME!"Would a WOMAN apologize for her feminine acts? So why should YOU apologize for your masculinity?-Tries to always win in what he does. (After childhood, there are real winners and losers in life.)Men build towers; women build webs. If you aren't constructing your tower or aren't even planning it, why should she cast her web at you? If you want worthy chicks, you, yourself, must strive to become worthy.-Has deep convictions that allows him to be a possible leader.This is crucial because one day you will become the leader of your own household. Yes, we talk of 50/50, of everything being equal, but Nature's laws surpass that of Humans. Women naturally submit and nurture, Men naturally lead and provide.If you were a woman, would YOU want a Nice Guy in charge of your household? Or would you want A MAN?-Seeks to solve problems then to place blame.If there is a problem, you solve it. You do not go, "Oh, BOO HOO! This was because of HIM." A woman naturally wants a guy who deals with problems, not pass them along. (Would you want that in your woman? Of course not!)-Sees failure as only a temporary set-back to the inevitable.Statistically, you're more likely to be REJECTED then to be ACCEPTED. So how do you become more and more accepted and have lots of girls? It is when you increase your trying so much that the acception rate satisfies you and you don't notice the rejections.Napoleon Hill's book interviewing extremely successful people, these men of destiny did not let failure destroy them. Indeed, Napoleon concludes that Destiny puts out these trials and failures to TEST the men if they are proper and FIT for their role in shaping history.-Knows where he is going in Life.True seduction isn't calculation or painful discipline, it is the same as with everything that makes a success: A Passion for Life.-Never loses his passion, for that would be the death of his soul.Nice Guys HATE bachelorhood. They HATE, HATE, HATE it sooo much. Some even wish for the old days of arranged marriages so they wouldn't have to put up with all the games.Jerks LOVE bachelorhood so much they can't see anything else in life. While women love guys that can get women, jerks offer nothing worthwile long term wise.Alas, the women always try to change the Jerk but never the Nice Guy. Why? Because a Man is STRENGTH and a Jerk displays strength on some level. Nice Guys never do.-Never feels he has to prove himself to anyone.Flowers, candy, poetry all can be good additions to a relationship, but so many nice guys use them to BUY the relationship as if they must prove themselves. They flood with the poor woman with gifts to show they mean it.So away with the flowers, those dead plants as tokens of affection. Away with the choclate, the candy, and sweets, those sugary pursuits to purchase love. Away with the poety, those rotten verses of declarations of love. Away with the quest to prove YOURSELF and let her prove HERSELF to you for YOU are the Don Juan.Be a Man! And with it, you will advance in your career, your social life, and even your dealings with women. Men are very rare these days so if you become one, you will be in HIGH demand. Your career will become better as people look at you as a leader. Life will re-develop before your eyes for you will obtain the most single quality that men, not trophy husbands, not nice guys, not tactiful players, but men have a monopoly on: Respect.YOU are the MAN! For if you don't STAND for something, you shall FALL for everything!

    <h3>
    For all the SHY guys out there... 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Hey boys,If you're reading this, you are likely a "Shy Guy".  Meaning you find yourself retreating and not speaking around women.  You don't make advances toward women.  You sit around on a Saturday night playing video games, or if you do go to a club you would have better spent your time playing video games.  Okay, well this one's for you guys.  I'm GIVING you the answer you need.  I'm not gonna hold your hand on this one.  You either do these things, or you ain't gonna get any woman worth the time of day.  C'mon, who do you wanna be.  Ferris Buller, or his loser friend Cameron?1. STOP F*CKIN' WHINING.   Only YOU can overcome your own shyness.  You're being a f*ckin' p*ssy.  There is a miracle cure for overcoming shyness.  It's called growing up.  You are the center of your own universe.  2. END THE "NICE GUY" PROBLEM FIRST   Being shy isn't your f*ckin' problem to begin with.  Fact of the matter is, you're a "Nice Guy" and you're not gonna get any with that hangin over your head.  It's time to grow up.  Be a f*ckin' man.  You've got your head full of romantic ideas about love.  Newsflash, you're a guy!  READ EVERY ARTICLE YOU CAN ON THIS SITE ABOUT NICE GUYS!  STOP BEING "THAT GUY"3. ACTION   You're too f*ckin' scared that you're going to say or do something that will offend the girl you like.  WHO CARES?  When you want something, you have to go out and get it.  It's not going to magically fall in your lap.  What you've been doing up until now OBVIOUSLY does NOT WORK.  You've got to present yourself as a MAN, and ACT LIKE ONE! 4. FEELINGS   Women want a MAN.  You know a MAN's MAN.  A Steve McQueen or a James Bond.  MEN have 3 Feelings... HAPPY, MAD, & DON'T GIVE A F*CK.  P*ssies have feelings like melancholy, existentialism, depression, romantic feelings.  Women don't want a p*ssy boyfriend, they want a man.  Nothing turns a woman off quite like an effeminate guy like you.5. RESEARCH   Do your homework, find out what dating and mating is all about.  You've been raised with a woman's viewpoint about relationships.  It's time you f*ckin' woke up.  Watch "Desmond Moriss' The Human Animal" for the inside track on dating and mating.  Find out what women are looking for.  It's a biological drive for women to find a MAN.6. YOU'RE A GUY   Realize that!  Live it!  Men are not intimidated by women?  Why should we be?  We're Bigger, Stronger, More Successful, And BETTER LOOKING.  Why else do you think women wear make-up and perfume... cuz they're ugly and they stink.  You're letting a WOMAN intimidate you?  How does THAT make you feel.  You're a GUY!  YOU dictate the terms of your relationship to a woman.  Whether you're going to be her friend, or lover.  If you want to be her lover, don't settle for friend, either you go out or you move on.  7. STOP POSTING AND START SEARCHING  There are hundreds of articles on this site on this topic alone.

Your Task: Please use the cut and functionof your favorite word processor to fix thispersonal relationship guide to yourlove life. Search and Replace all occurancesof "INVESTING" with "LIVING YOUR LIFE FULLY W/ WOMEN" and "MONEY" with "RELATIONSHIPS".  ****************************LOVE RETURNS!In the last edition of the Burley Chronicles you were introduced to the Nine Generalized Principles of Investing. You will recall that Generalized Principles apply to all situations whereas Rules are personal and are used to set up how YOU invest.We will begin this article by talking about "The Game." For the purpose of clarity you should understand when I say, "The Game" I am referring to Money.I call it "The Game" because to Level Five Active Investors that is exactly what Money and Investing are: a game. A game that we all love to play to win!In fact, this concept links to the first and most important of the Nine Generalized Principles of Investing. To play "The Game" you must LOVE what you are doing. To be a successful Level Five Active Investor you must do something that excites you, moves you and thrills you. Without this passion for what you do, lifes challenges and learning experiences can all too easily knock you off your path.The concept of The Game of Money can be broken down into practical steps that you can apply:1. Discover an area of investing that you feel is a "Good Fit" for you; 2. Apply the Nine Generalized Principles of Investing; 3. Develop your own Rules to the Game. As you recall in the last issue we discussed applying the Nine Generalized Principles of Investing. After you have found your area of investment passion and applied the Nine Generalized Principles to it you must then apply YOUR Rules to The Game.Remember that it is YOUR GAME and you can play it any way you want. Be like a little kid: if others wont play your way then just take your ball and go find others who will play your way.Take a good look at the Rules (conscious or automatic) that you are currently using with regards to money and investing. Are YOUR Rules empowering or limiting your financial success?A typical example of how Rules can limit your success:I have met people who tried something and it didnt work the first time so they decided NEVER to try it again. Maybe this sounds familiar? The scenario might run something like this: you decide to buy shares based on a "hot" tip you got at the water cooler. Of course, right after you buy (at the top of the market) the share crashes to an all-time low, wiping out half your money. You sell immediately and decide to NEVER invest in the share market again because it is too risky.For many this example may be all too real.The problem with your action is not that you bought the shares or that you lost money but that you decided to NEVER invest in the share market again because of the loss. You made a Rule that will prevent you from EVER making money in the Stock Market.And your "rational" mind will constantly remind you of YOUR RULE. Regardless of how good the market is, you will not participate. When anyone ever questions you on why you will not invest in the market you will defend YOUR RULE to the ends of the earth with endless "logical" reasons why one should never invest in the stock market. This is your own "intelligent" psycho-babble. The end result: you lose because you are out of The Game!In the example cited what you should have done is learned what you could do differently to enhance your probability for success. In the future: do not buy impulsively at the top of the market; check the source of your information; do Market Research; use a stop-loss to limit your potential liability so you cannot lose so much, etc.Translation: add a Rule to never play that way again, not a Rule to never play The Game (invest) again.EVERY day I learn new ways to do something or to not do something. I never quit The Game. I merely adjust My Game to incorporate what I learn. You should do the same.Rule 1. is that I play by My Rules, not the rules of anyone else. Level Five Active Investors know that they must have control at all times. Thus they cannot play by the rules dictated by others (such as so called expert financial planners, accountants, lawyers, tax planners, brokers and bankers who all too often play by the rules of "It Cant be Done" or "We Dont Do That Here"). Level Five Active Investors design their own Rules and adapt the world to them rather than complying with and adapting to the rules of others.Note: this does not mean breaking the law! All that I do, whether in the area of business, tax planning, entity strategies, or investing is all completely legal and above board. There is no room in the business and investing world of the Level Five Investor (where your reputation is as vital as your skills), for shades of gray. There is no need. Everything I could ever want to do can be achieved using my own rules, within the framework of existing laws, regulations and codes. I only do what is "white as the driven snow." I strongly recommend you do the same.Rule 2. The Nine Generalized Principles of Active InvestingAlways respect and follow the Nine Generalized Principles of Active (Level Five) Investing. They are the blueprints upon which to build your Rules.Rule 3. Integrity It is my belief that the most important quality a person can demonstrate in business and in life is Integrity. If I find that the people I am playing (working or investing) with do not have integrity I stop playing (doing business) with them. I take my ball and go home. And I only play games (businesses and investments) which are compatible with and can be fashioned around my integrity beliefs.I have learned the hard way that people with a lack of or questionable integrity will usually turn on you or let you down before the deal is done. Always remember: the Integrity of the other person is more important than any other aspect of the deal!Integrity must always be your starting point and youre ending point. If you deal with people without integrity you will damage yourself each time. Their association or short term profit appeal is not worth the sacrifices you will invariably make.I have read some wonderful passages over the years on the subject of integrity, written by great businesspeople, but none better than the selection I would like to share with you here.Horace Greeley, the founder of the New Yorker in 1834 and coiner of the phrase "Go West young man, go West!" once wrote in a speech on the subject of the "true business man" the following passage:"I close, then, with some suggestions as to what I consider the bases of a true business career  those which give reasonable assurance of a true business success. I place first among this, integrity: because I believe that there is to day a good deal of misapprehension on this point. There is now and then a case of brilliant rascality known among us; and we hear of this, and talk of it; we are inclined, some of us, to admire it; but, after all, there are no cases, except very exceptional cases, wherein roguery has led to fortune. The rule is almost absolute, that our thrifty men have been essentially upright men. You will find few cases where the dishonest man has continuously flourished. There have been cases of his temporary, transient, meteoric success; but the rule is very uniform in its operation, that business success has been based on a broad platform of integrity."P.T. Barnum wrote in an often-delivered speech entitled "The Art of Money-Getting" the following passage on integrity and its relationship to wealth creation:"It is more precious than diamonds or rubies. The old miser said to his sons: "Get money; get it honestly, if you can, but get money." This advice was not only atrociously wicked, but it was the very essence of stupidity. It was as much as to say, "If you find it difficult to obtain money honestly, you can easily get it dishonestly. Get it in that way." Poor fool, not to know that the most difficult thing in life is to make money dishonestly; not to know that our prisons are full of men who attempted to follow this advice; not to understand that no man can be dishonest without soon being found out, and that when his lack of principle is discovered, nearly every avenue to success is closed against him forever. The public very properly shuns all whose integrity is doubted. No matter how polite and pleasant and accommodating a man may be, none of us dare to deal with him if we suspect "false weights and measures." Strict honesty not only lies at the foundation of all the success in life financially, but in every other respect. Uncompromising integrity of character is invaluable. It secures to its possessor a peace and joy which cannot be attained without it  which no amount of money, or houses and lands can purchase."And finally from Samuel Johnson in Rasselas (1759):"Integrity without knowledge is weak and useless, and knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful."Integrity! Find it within. Follow it through everything you are and do. For without it you are incomplete and live without true meaning. One last thought on Integrity. A very wise person once said, "Once someone shows you who they are, believe them!" In other words, if someone shows you once in a business dealing or in general life that they do not have integrityBELIEVE THEM! They will invariably continue on their path of deceit and dishonesty in their dealings with you until you no longer let them.Rule 4. Know the RulesBefore I play "The Game" I want to know four things:A. The Rules of the Market; B. The Rules of "The Game" (based on my Niche); C. The Rules to maximize ROIAT (Return on Investment after Tax) Maximization; D. My Personal Rules. Rule 5. Buy Wholesale As an investor I know that to make a profit I must buy wholesale (or sub-wholesale) and then resell at retail (or just below). This is what all great investors do in one form or another, whether they are buying shares that are undervalued or out of favor, vehicles at below red book value or real estate at wholesale prices.When I invest I need at least one of two aspects of the deal to be wholesale: I need wholesale price or wholesale terms. Wholesale purchase price means the amount of cash in the deal will produce a retail sale price. Wholesale terms will produce higher cash flow to compensate for the higher than wholesale purchase price. Wholesale price and wholesale terms in the same deal is the Level Five Investors nirvana.Rule 6. Profit at Purchase Make your money when you buy, not when you sell.When making a decision on how much to offer for a property I make my decision solely based on the cash flow or calculated capital gains profit after expenses (not potential appreciation or negative cash flow (negative-gearing) tax benefits).I NEVER include tax savings or appreciation for the simple reason that they are undetermined constantly changing, and not guaranteed.Beware of salespeople cloaked as Real Estate Agents or Marketers, StockBrokers, Financial Planners, Investment Advisors, etc. All those fancy charts, brochures, and presentations are designed to fool you. Do not ever buy an investment based on "projected yields" or "future appreciation" or "potential tax savings." That is the "game" of the Level Three Investor.Whenever these salespeople approach me with their investment schemes I tell them the following: I have an investment portfolio of several million dollars. I consistently make 50-100% annually on my investments. However, I am always looking to improve my return. At this point in the conversation the salesperson gets very enthusiastic as they begin to go into their sales pitch, telling me how they can make me all this money. I ask them to send me a copy of their audited financial statement.I tell them that if they are doing better than me (on return, not necessarily net worth) then they have got my money (to invest). I also ask for a copy of their last statement showing how much money they have placed in this investment.Guess what? In all the years not one investment salesperson has ever responded to my requests. The reason? They probably dont really know what they are doing and they probably do not have any of their own money invested in the product they are offering (nor any other investment for that matter).When it comes to investing I care about two things: The Money and the Numbers! The REAL numbers! What is my cash-on-cash return going to be this year? If I cannot make money now, I am not interested in the deal. Period. End of story!Rule 7. No/Low RiskPresently I only have at risk a small percentage (less than 1%) of MY net worth in any one investment. I do this because even though I have never lost money on a Real Estate investment, I continue to eliminate the possibility (fear) of being financially ruined by a couple of deals gone bad.However, when I first became an Active Investor I often risked up to 10% of my net worth in a single transaction. The reason was two-fold: I had a relatively small net worth; and I wanted to maximize leverage to accelerate my wealth-building process. If I had taken a loss at that time I was confident that I would still move forward. That was my mindset. Those were My Rules. Bear that in mind. For many people a loss would have resulted in a full retreat from ever investing again.Clarification: when I say that I only have less than 1% of my net worth at risk in any one investment I am not saying that I only have 1% invested in total. What I am saying is that I have used Level Five investment techniques (Principles and Rules) to limit my downside risk to just 1% of any given investment. I generally have at least 90-95% of my investment capital invested at any one time. Just not 90-95% of it at risk! I minimize my risk by following proper money management risk reduction strategies.Rule 8. Other People's MoneyOne money management risk reduction strategy is to use OPM (Other Peoples Money) to further reduce your risk. I have done this to the point where I have acquired over 150 properties using none of my own money. (Many of my students throughout the world have done the same types of transactions.) Thats Leverage with No Money Down! Using OPM is part of Rule #7 because it is as No/Low Risk as it gets. If I have no money in the deal, I have no money at risk.In addition, leverage allows me to do far more transactions than I ever could on my own. I often do transactions with partners because I know it is always better to have a piece of the pie than none of the pie.My partners are willing to take on the risks for the capital invested and thus my risk in minimal. My integrity is what my partners rely upon over time, not on the basis of any one deal (although they are of course backing my business acumen as well). My partners are willing to risk their capital for good returns and I stake my expertise and my reputation for the opportunity of leverage offered by their investment capital.The relationship I have with my investors (money partners) has produced tremendous success over the years and we have NEVER lost money on a real estate investment. In fact, I cannot even conceive the possibility of losing money on real estate. My Buy Wholesale Investment Rule and my business systems are all designed to ensure that we do not ever lose money on a deal.Rule 9. Money Back I structure my transactions so that if I have money in the deal I get all of it back in the quickest possible time.Remember, one of the major objectives for money is to employ it so that it works for you. Once you retrieve your initial investment capital, your money begins working for you at a rate of return of infinity (which, by the way, is the best possible rate of return!)I invest in such a way that my money partners and I get all of the principle back within 1-2 years which means that we make 50-100%+ rates of return on each investment (each property).10. Don't Wanters I buy from people who really do not want their property.This means that I generally buy my properties from highly motivated sellers (trustees of deceased estates or bankruptcies, liquidators, vacant properties, builder closeouts, mortgages in possession, sheriff sales, mortgage sales, trustee sales, foreclosures, etc.).If someone does not want their property they are much more likely to be flexible on their price or terms to dispose of it. You are entering the market on Wholesale Price and/or Wholesale Terms which will allow you to easily determine your Profit at Purchase.In any market, no matter how good, somewhere between 2-5% of sellers are highly motivated to sell. Though these deals take effort to find, my students from throughout the world find them just. Whether you are in the United States, Canada, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South America, Europe, or Africa these opportunities are readily available to the Level Five Investor who knows how and where to look. And when presented with a written wholesale offer these sellers will often respond in a way that allows the Level Five Investor to lock-up a Profit at Purchase.Rule 11. Cash Flow Although I make a Quick Cash profit from the sale of a property and I often acquire properties intentionally to flip just for Quick Cash, I do prefer to generate as much of my profit as possible in the form of Cash Flow. That is my Game and what I love: Passive Income.To achieve this, I acquire properties wholesale and then re-market them with Vendor Financing (owner financing) or a Lease Purchase Agreement (at retail).I prefer the liberating power that comes from receiving a check at the beginning of each and every month whether or not I work directly for it.For me, wealth is Cash Flow, not cash. My problem with cash is that it has a tendency to get spent. Cash Flow continues ad infinitum.12. Lunch Pail Joe Although I do use several investment vehicles, my main specialty is Real Estate. And with regards to real estate I primarily invest in single family homes that meet my "Lunch Pail Joe" definition:A. Priced 20% or more below the median (not average) price of the target area; B. 3 bed/ 1+ bath (1000-1500 sq.ft. /100-160 sq.m.); C. Covered parking; D. Fenced yard; E. Livable condition; F. Acceptable neighborhood; G. No more than 60 minutes away from my home or office (unless you live in a very rural area). H. I have found that by investing in "regular houses" in "regular neighborhoods" where "regular people" live, I am in a position to profit whether the market is good or bad. The reason: someone always needs a place to live. And in regular neighborhoods you always have a market because people are continually moving up or moving down. For real estate investing purposes I greatly prefer "regular" houses.13. No Emotions When I invest my primary concern is the Return on Investment after Taxes (ROIAT). In an investment what matters most is the Bottomline: The Money and the Numbers.I dont care what color the carpet is or about the pretty garden. Just give me the numbers and Ill show you the money!The numbers are the most important aspect of investing. Emotions should never play a part in the investment decision. I always tell students who contact me for assistance, "Dont tell me about the house. Tell me about the numbers." Be like the professionals. Dont get emotionally involved. Get Rich instead.This does not mean that you have no emotion attached to what you do. Make no mistake. If you dont have an underlying love for Your Game you are likely to fail or at best under-achieve. If the deal stacks up you are allowed to "feel good" about the "money and the numbers." This is not really an emotional reaction. Your response should be purely analytical, based on the deal satisfying YOUR RULES.Be prepared to make some mistakes or errors of judgment when investing. Learn from them and leave them behind. Do not attach emotions to these experiences. Take the lessons analytically. You love the Game, not any one deal or investment. Your future does not depend upon the success of any one deal or investment (at least not if you follow the Nine Generalized Principles of Investing). The numbers make the deal. Learn to love them too.14. Ride the Winners, Cut the Losers I have learned that most people "Cut their Winners and Ride their Losers." They often do this because of the recommendations of their "professional" advisors.Stockbrokers for example are trained to tell you to "sell" when you make a small profit and to "hold" on to shares that have gone down. Why would you want to sell an investment that was going up, or continue to hold on to one that had dramatically fallen in value, when there were better opportunities elsewhere?Brokers are trained give you this advice for two reasons. First they understand that psychologically most people have a HUGE need to be right. They know that if you have lots of "Wins," no matter how small, you will feel good about yourself. You can tell all your friends about how you made money in the markets with your great broker. They also know that most people cannot psychologically accept losses and that is why they tell you to hold onto your shares that have gone down. For most people, not actually selling means they dont have to deal with the loss. They can pretend it is not really a loss because they fool themselves into thinking that the stock will come back some day (NOT ALL STOCKS (SHARES) COME BACK!). So, they just continue on their merry way constantly selling far too early their good shares and holding onto the bad stocks for eternity. They "Cut their Winners and Ride their Losers".The second reason this advice is sometimes given is because the broker wants to continue to make commissions when you sell and then reinvest (over and over and over again). This is called "churning" and it generates a steady stream of commissions for the broker and the brokerage.How often have you or someone you know sold an investment for a respectable profit only to see the investment continue to go through the roof? Do you know someone who sold Intel, Dell or even Commonwealth Bank five years ago?Conversely, how often have you held on to an investment despite the fact that it was a "Dog" hoping that some day it would come back? How often has your dogged determination to be right cost you dearly?Top investors "Ride the Winners and Cut the Losers." They do this primarily through strict money management and tight control over their own investment psychology. You should learn to do the same.15. Invest Long TermMost people look at far too short a time frame in regard to their investments. They spend much time chopping and changing, running around looking for the next "Get Rich Quick" scheme or hot investment. The reality is that there are very few surefire and rapid-fire roads to Riches. Rather, the majority of Get Rich investments take time to bring home large returns. Like the reality of the twenty-year overnight success in show business.That is why when I invest, I primarily do so for the long-term. I am not interested in "spending" assets after short or mid-term gains. I am looking towards my longer-term goals of wealth-building and stewardship of my assets. Many of the best investments carry with them the power of compounding and Lag and are not designed to be readily capitalized upon over the short term.So when you assess an investment, be clear on your goals, your Dividend Expectation Timeframe (DET) and do not ignore an investment simply because you believe its benefits are not instantaneous. Check the numbers and understand the power of money invested over time. You are building wealth and this takes time. I invest for the long term.16. Open Mind to Adapt RulesAlways be prepared, based upon your Market Research, to adapt YOUR RULES to a changing market to your own best advantage. Many businesses fail dramatically due to dogged determination to stick to timeworn, but inflexible business practices or attitudes.You must always keep an open mind in relation to the expectations and changes of your market. Nowhere has this requirement been more dramatically demonstrated in recent years than in the effects and market expectations for e-commerce on western world businesses.17. Continuing EducationKeep current on your Market Research at all times and practice your skills of Lateral Thinking to keep up with or anticipate the changes. I am constantly attending seminars, reading and learning. Throughout the world I seek out the best teachers and information I can find. I then pay to attend their seminars as a student to learn what they have to teach.People ask me how often I attend other peoples seminars and why? Well, in 1999 I attended 12 seminars as a student (and sometimes as a guest speaker). I paid many thousands of dollars for the seminars) and the additional books, tapes and manuals I bought at them). Why? Because you can never know enough and you can always learn more. Even if the seminar or material proves to be disappointing, I can always learn at least one new thing. Often there is considerable value in learning what is not important, valuable or legitimate, and thereby reinforcing what you already know.I strive to continually learn more to improve myself, my relationships, my psychology, my business and my investing. By attending seminars, listening to tapes, watching videos and reading, I accomplish this. Education is an ongoing process and I strongly encourage you to continue your learning beyond your completion of the Money Secrets program.If you aspire to become a Level Five Active Investor I recommend that you take a long hard look at how your Principles and Rules compare with those of top Level Five and Level Six Investors.Reinforce those things you are doing right and learn from those things that you need to change. Make sure that you continually review The Nine Generalized Principles and your own Rules to make sure that you are staying on top of your Market.I know that if you apply the Nine Generalized Principles and follow YOUR RULES that you will WIN "The LOVE Game."*******************Adapted from and taken from www.dealmakerscafe.com [This message has been edited by dorian_gray-from.usa (edited 03-29-2001).][This message has been edited by dorian_gray-from.usa (edited 03-29-2001).]

    My 3 month plan for success w/ women 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Well it could take more than 3 mos but here it goes... First Month Take an inventory of all of your weak points. Be Ruthless. Write it all down. Then picture how you want to appear. Maybe it's more confident or smarter or tougher. Whatever. Again. Write it down.Next set realistic  goals as to how you are going to make those improvements over the next four weeks. Maybe talking to one girl a week, or going to the gym three times a week or whatever.  Every morning when you wake up review this list and think about what you are going to do that day to work towards these goals.HOWEVER>>>>>>DO NOT FOCUS ON ANY ONE WOMEN AT THIS TIME. You are not trying to date at all here! This is time for you to improve. Be Selfish!Second Month First of all look at your progress. You probably didn't meet all your goals, step up the ones you did and reaffirm those you didn't.Next thing is to get an interest, that is if you don't have one. I don't mean anything mundane like computer junk or baseball. Get an interest that people will identify you by. "That guy who welds sculptures" "The bowhunter" "The triathlete" Whatever.This is important for a multitude of reasons but mostly b/c 1) it shows you are passionate about something (why do you think women love musicians even if they're ugly?) and 2)it makes you stand out as someone who does his own thing, is confident and makes their own life interesting (ie. you'd do the same to hers)Still do not focus on any one woman. Keep it to research and practice. Third Month Evaluate your progress and up your goals again. Next trying to talk to any women at all. See if you can get to be friends with more women, from class, or work. This might go against common thought, but it actually does a few things for you. 1)gives you social proof (another girl is vouching for you)and expands the network of cool girls you meet with minimal effort. The friends of your friends turn into dating prospects or friends and it continues exponentially.Fianlly Come out of your Cocoon. You'll be happier, healthier and more confident and you'll have become much more attractive w/o worrying about eye contact and pick up lines.I guarante that this will work if you really try it for three months. It took me a lot longer than that and I'm still learning and improving but...its worth it.

OK. So you don't have a girlfriend. You're not getting any sex. On your current course, you're about to become a Monk. You feel down and saddened.Why!?"But Pook, I got no girl!" That is not the problem. The problem is that you place your happiness on a girl. You can't be happy in a relationship unless you're happy being single. Get away, endulge yourself in your hobbies and work. Whatever you do, do not sit there and regurgitate your emotions. Take Action.But the more common is, "But Pook, I am doing my hobbies and work. I have a natural need for intimacy. I am tired of being single!"And I am sure it is especially burning that you walk around and see these happy couples, hand in hand, with huge smiles on their faces, almost as if they are mocking you. But fear not! You are way ahead of the other males.How do most guys act? Either they are Nice Guys or Jerks, very rarely are there true Good Guys.Nice GuysLook at these guys in their relationships or in their marriages. You know who wears the pants in the relationship. These poor guys never understood the Game and are just relieved to have settled down. They are AFCs for life.Most nice guys spend their 20's in misery until women in their 30's are ready to settle down. It is so sad to see these AFCs in such manner.Some got a bit wise and looked at Dating Books. Unfortunately, most books make Nice Guys more feminine because they are written on what women SAY but not what they DO.These poor chaps have no backbone! I watched my (then) roomate get a call from a girl saying that she was hungry and because she was studying, HE was to go to Subway to get her a sandwhich! Alas, he did this. This patheticness is not the exception, it is the common.See that cutie pie in those oh so tight pants? Most guys would chicken out in approaching her. In fact, many would go, "Run! Don't let us know that we are looking at her!" Pathetic! Pathetic! Pathetic!Or the guy who calls the girl of his affections night after night, hour after hour? Pathetic!When I was young, I remember a guy driving ALL the way to my house (I live out in the boonies) to return to my sister a glove. She was pleasant but didn't let him get in the front door. She said to me, "Whatever you do, do not act like that. Do not call a girl all the time. Do not act that way."Or a co-worker, completely infatuated, follows the girl around like a puppy. The proximity is obvious. When he wasn't around, all the girls would get together and laugh and joke at him, all declaring how pathetic he was. Aren't you glad you're not that guy now?When my sister and her boyfriend were going out, my sister was breaking up and getting back together with him again and again and again. He wised up and eventually thundered, "Listen woman! Either stay with me or go! Make up your damn mind." She stayed with him and the two married. If he was a 'nice guy' and scared of confrontation, do you think she would have stayed with him? No.What about the guys who just sit there and wait for girls to approach them? In their mind, they think, "Please ask me out!" Guys should never count on women to ask them out.Or in the married life, nice guys who are afraid to lead because of their passitivity. They often marry the wrong woman because they are so tender to their own emotions and oblivious to reality. Indeed, there are shmiels who's wifes cheat on them constantly... and they put up with it.JerkThese and the Nice Guy are but one of the same, while a Nice Guy introverts himself, the Jerk extroverts himself. While the Nice Guy is constantly passive, the Jerk is constantly aggressive.While the Nice Guy hides his sexuality and can't get chicks to be attracted to him (but are good long term relationship material, as girls confirm by saying to Nice Guy, "You're not the type of guy I'd date, you're the type I'd marry") the jerk erupts his sexuality everywhere, gets chicks attracted to him, but can never keep them.The jerk has no confidence, which is why he is a jerk in the first place. True criticisms sting him and collapses his spirit.Notice how the Jerk may get chicks long enough for sex, he fails completely in life. He ends up being a janitor or something similiar. The girls he bedded with? All of them insecure little girls. It is pathetic and very very sad.Some guys have gotten confident enough to take action, talk to girls, etc. But very few have true backbone. Even fewer then that have the Don Juan skills expressed in the articles and on this forum.Most guys are pathetic. Most are chumps. Women simply get tired of looking and will 'settle' for who they are with. It is so sad.But you, on the other hand, you are not a chump and are definetely not pathetic. You are a good catch. Fear not having no intimacy right now, for with your mindset and skills will ensure you luxurious intimacy for the course of your life.Can the Passive (Nice) Guy speak of true passion within his relationship? Can the Jerk (Coward) speak of true success and true maturity within relationships? Of course not.You are enlightened and know something 99% of the other guys do not: how to handle women. For if you don't, women will handle you.One out of four marriages is when the woman never loved the guy anyway but just 'settled down'. Out of the 'love' marriages, most of the women fall out of love. More women then men commit adultery. 80% of relationships are broken up by women.Why is this!? Mostly, because of patheticness. When you get down, think of all the guys that suffer from this. Then realize that you are truly free, for you possess the knowledge that makes you a Man.------------------Pook"As you think, you shall become.""Men will be nice when nice guys get laid."

    <h3>
    The Relationship Begins Before You Meet Her 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Tomorrow you are going to wake up with a wonderful idea. You will race out of bed, turn on your computer, and begin authoring an important document. It will be a detailed description of Mrs. Don Juan, the woman you will eventually marry, but have yet to meet.Using your imagination, you will profile her age, physical characteristics, education and career goals. You will describe her personality, demeanor, interests, likes and dislikes. You will profile her life experiences and how she has dealt with adversity. More importantly, you will describe her personal flaws. (Remember this isnt a fantasy girl, this your future wife.)  You will detail flaws in her appearance, personality and character. You will also describe how at some point in her life, she recognized those flaws and how she has made positive efforts to minimize them. Most importantly, you will put your own ego and desires aside and describe what Mrs. Don Juan requires and desires from you. This will be the toughest part of the document to write, but it will not be complete unless you do it. You will realistically describe everything that she wants from you with as much detail as when you described everything you wanted from her. After completing the document, you will print out a small copy and keep it with you in your wallet. That way, Mrs. Don Juan will always be with you and a part of you. You will then come to the realization that the two of you will never meet unless you improve yourself in order meet her requirements and desires as stated in the last portion of your document. You will develop a self-improvement regimen based on two proven reality factors:1) Women need men with Confidence, Control, and Challenge.2) Women want men with Looks, Money, and Power.The first place youll head off to is the gym. While working out, youll experience instant improvements in your posture, thus enhancing your Confidence. The better-looking body will come in time. After the first workout, youll go to the mens section of the local store. Youll stock up on some hair and skin products. Perhaps buy some cologne. When you come back home youll see that rising stack of bills on your table, so you pull out the old check book and resolve to take better care of your finances and organize your time. Phase One of your relationship with Mrs. Don Juan will have begun.Months will pass and youll start to see some results from your hard work. Your body will be more fit, you will have adopted a more clean and neat appearance and your financial improvements will have created a sizable amount of disposable income. You will resolve to read more books thus enhancing your overall knowledge and vocabulary. Youll resolve to spend more time around people, thus learning social skills and how to exude charisma. You will no longer hesitate in asking a woman for her home phone number. The increase in your level of self-confidence will have eliminated your fear of risk-taking. Youll enjoy the process of constantly growing and improving. No longer will you be doing it for Mrs. Don Juan. Youll be improving yourself, for yourself. More months will pass and you will have eliminated the personal flaws in your own character and replaced them better, more productive habits. You wont date as often as your buddies, but the few dates you do go on will always be with interested women, because you will have long since learned to show Control and Challenge by screening the losers out. You will be at peace with yourself and be just an overall happier person, thus more popular. You will posses Power not just from your personal accomplishments, but also from the quality relationships you will have developed with close friends and family.You will be a complete man. You will have satisfied all of Mrs. Don Juans requirements and desires. Only then will she appear to you in the flesh. Youll pull the document out of your wallet and be utterly amazed. She will be almost everything that you described in your profile of her long ago. Phase Two of your relationship with her will then begin.When the two of you are married and on your honeymoon, Mrs. Don Juan will often refer to the moment she saw you for the first time as the moment when the relationship began for her. Shell say it was love at first sight. She wont be lying when she says that. That will just be her perspective of things.You, however, will know that you simply passed her physical attraction test when she met you for the first time. But for you, the relationship with her will have begun long before then. It will have begun when you resolved to become everything Mrs. Don Juan wants and needs out of a husband, with no respect to your own ego.We as guys tend to often think that relationships begin only after weve banged her. Not true.The relationship begins before you meet her.[This message has been edited by Survivor (edited 07-04-2001).]

    Overcoming FEAR is easy when you know how... 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


What is fear besides a 4 letter word? Fear is that voice which tells you what you should and shouldn't do. It's the voice that tells you to avoid talking to that hot chick or to run away from problems in your life.The way I see it, fear is like a bully that tries to intimidate you. The more you listen to it and become a slave to it. The harder and stronger it comes onto you. But if you'll stand up to it, it dissappears. Because it knows it has no power over you.It has been said by many wise men over the years that fear is like an evil energy, which penetrates everyone who will allow it to! Picture yourself as a house, and all these enemies are trying to get in through your front door. If you stand up to them and tell them to get lost and lock the door. They leave. BUt if you leave the door wide open, in they come! They will hunt you and destroy your dreams! The next time fear trys to stop you from walking over and talking to that girl accross the room. Say to yourself mentally "back off! I'm not listen to this crap!" and walk right through the fear! You will notice that the fear will grab you (psychologically) and hold you back! This is when you need to be really strong and pull forward and do what feel is in your best interests!Rob

    Dependancy Breeds FEAR! 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


It's a psychological fact. That anything you depend upon breeds fear. In other words. If you depend on something to be there. You also live in fear of losing that thing that you depend on so much.So It goes to say, if your happiness and piece of mind are depending on the day that some girl will walk into your life and give you all of that. You are also in fear of not achieving that goal. This hidden fear will become apparent in the way you walk,talk and interact with women. It has also been proven recently, that a sixth scence does exist.And it seems to be bestowed upon women, more than men. So girls can also scence your dependancy on them, and this turns them off.You need to constantly tell yourself that you don't need a woman to come into your life. But if it happens.

    Becoming a Rare Commodity can make you an instant success with girls!

If you've been looking for that extra advantage to make your self more ATTRACTIVE towards women/girls! This is for you!! I would suggest you read the following in its entirity and do your best to apply it.The other day I observed something very interesting when my younger cousines(8 & 9) years old, came over to visit. We had this bag of candy that contained cherry, lime, grape, orange, and blueberry flavored candy. The funny thing about it was that there was only 3 or 4 blueberry candies in the bag, compared to 15-20 candies in the other 4 flavors.What I observed was that these 2 children litterally crawled over each other to get there hands on the blueberry flavored candy. When I asked them why they wanted that flavor so badly. They couldn't give me a straight answer. It later dawned on me, that the reason they wanted the blueberry flavor so badly was that it was RARE. It certainly wasn't the best tasting or best looking flavor/color in the pile, but it was rare! Therefor it was precieved as being far more valuable!Now imagin yourself begin the rare blue candy amoung all the other guys out there. and those children begining the pretty girls your after!You see, it is a psychological fact that we place more value on something that is rare and hard to find. We precieve things that come to easily or that are abundant as being valueless.  Thats why gold is so valuable and sand is precieved as being worthless! Gold is a rare commodity!With that said, you don't need to worry about being the best looking guy there. Or the best dressed or whatever. If you can find something about yourself that sets you apart from every other guy there(or at least most other guys) You are now going to be seen as a rare commodity. and your value will skyrocked because of it!

    Face Off 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


I've had my sexual revolution after watching Bad Boys with Martin Lawrence and Will Smith years ago. Will Smith's character is so damn cool. I thought "This is the way to be." Tea Leoni's description made a lightbulb burn inside me. Okay it's a movie but it had the power to change my life. I was going to be the most masculine man in my town. I didn't even make the change to get girls but to get in peace with myself. A few tips Stop whining! Never tell people about your emotions. Specially not girls! Most of them are b*tches anyway. The most intimate and unique thing about yourself is how your spirit functions. Don't give it away. Not to anyone. The only true friend you have is yourself.  Cry every now and then. Alone off course. Always do it alone because we live in the year 2001; you can't impress anyone with a cry. Think about a thing that makes you cry. It cleans your spirit. You are human.  "Being in love" is temporary. It's those damn endorfines in your body. Get rid of it very quickly. However love is real and will stay forever. Love for the planet. Love for a person. Love for living. Being in love is nothing compared to real love. Do you know there are cases of people constantly falling in love because of a drug they're using. I'm not talking about XTC but drugs actually making people fall in love constantly. You are who you are. Only God or whatever you believe in can change you. You have to get the edges off. That's the only thing YOU can do. Not your girlfriend. Not your boss. You. If someone is doing a thing you don't like tell them not to do it. Everyone is testing everyone 24-7. Don't fail the test! It's absolutely essential that you say what you think without insulting anyone. Insulting is a weakness. Showing people that you do not tolerate their actions is a natural thing to do. A very admirable thing even. Example: Imagine your girlfriend is french-kissing with someone else. You don't say a word (you are thinking:"she'll forget about it tomorrow." No way. She's probably doing it because she f*cking likes it and wants to f*ck him eventually. ) and you'll end up with RSI in your hands. Say something and you'll keep your self-respect and maybe your girlfriend (because she now thinks highly of you.) If she decides to leave let her go to hell. Do not avoid anything that is a challenge to you and the prospects of achieving your goal are not very positive. Never avoid confrontation with that which you are afraid of. Avoid confrontation and the thought of not having faced that which bothers you will follow you and keep remembering you what a loser you are. Face that what bothers you. Most people (not all) talk like it's the end of the world when a mistake is made. There's almost always a way back after a mistake. Believe in yourself and the choices you've made and never say sorry for things you haven't done intentionally. You'll get a chance to prove yourself later. If you won't get that chance then say "hasta la vista baby" or something like that and move on. Face everything/everyone that bothers you. Think about it, analyse it, talk about it and solve it. The first time with everything is scary but after ten, twenty times  you can do it with no effort. When you were a baby you had harder things to learn. Like that almost symmetrical pattern of pink (or black (in the most positive meaning of the word)) that you saw with that smell was your mother. Then you learned that those curved writings are used to count things. Then you learned to make other people laugh. So if you would have avoided these (educative) situations you would not have gotten anywhere. Want to talk to that gorgeous girl who is so hot? Do it now. If things don't end up the way you want to then at least you can sleep easily and you can focus on new and different projects. Don't argue with your parents because of a girl. Your parents are always there for you. Your girlfriend isn't. Don't fear! Fear of dogs is not real fear unless it's phobic. Fear has many faces. Jealousy is a form of fear. Not taking risks is a form of fear. Lashing out is a form of fear. Avoiding difficult or scary situations at all costs is a form of fear. Not showing kino with the person you like is a form of fear. Worrying is a form of fear. Hesitation is a form of fear. Not looking in the eyes of a person is a form of fear. Not dealing with a problem is a form of fear. Not being able to face the truth is a form of fear. Not showing (different from telling about) feelings is a form of fear. Fear can only serve him who can deal with it.  You are fundamentally different from a female. You are stronger. You are supposed to protect her. You can read maps. You are more emotional but then again you can keep them under control. She can see and hear more. Bright light will irritate you much faster. She can easily do more things at once. She lives longer. She is sexier. You get more handsome as time passes. Women don't. These are biological differences and in the end you can only be a man when you start living (and this is not that biological) like one.  Have everything under control. Hang around with many women. Flirt and have sex with all. Don't start thinking women will see you as too aggressive because your being sexually open. You are who you are and everyone should shove their opinion up their own asses. When you're starting to think "I'm great" you are really starting to be great. Don't get carried away though because it'll probably end in depression.I was going to post advice on how to be a true Don Juan  (who can't count his lovers anymore) and on how to be a manipulative man who can make people do things for him but eventually that would hurt a lot of people. I'm not the only one who knows these things but posting them would be unethical. I hope other people also will not post advice on issues which are meant to hurt people."There is someone for everyone" (old saying)

The greatest barrier to achievement or success is not lack of talent or ability but rather, the fact that achievement and  success, beyond a certain level, are outside our self-concept - our image of who we are and what is appropriate to us.  The greatest barrier to love is the secret fear that we are unlovable.  The greatest barrier to happiness is the wordless sense that happinessis not our proper destiny.    - Nathaniel Branden.

Why so many postst about guys who think of themselves as being losers?Listen up, if you think that you are a loser, what exactly do you expect a girl to sense from you? Women like confident men, not some wimp who doesn't even love himself. If you think like a loser, that's exactly what you'll portray to everyone around you, and believe me; no one wants to be around a loser.If not even you believe in yourself, how do you expect others to believe in you. Always consider yourself as being the best motherf***er there is at everything that you do. Who cares if you are ugly; no one is perfect. Just dress nicely, clean yourself, exercise... do whatever you have to do to compensate for it, if you feel like it. If not, just be yourself, go out and talk to as many women as you can, ask for their phone #'s; eventually you'll get what you want after you do some hard work.Nothing comes easy...

If you don't do anything, and sit on your ass like a nice guy, you are already down for the count. You rejected YOURSELF.

    The Vortex of Morphological Fields

So you know how to seduce a girl in theory. You've even become confident in real life. You know almost everything you need to know about flirting, seduction and self-respect. What next??? It's like when you have graduated from university and your question is "What am I supposed to do now?" Go with the flow. Do the things you'd normally do in your life but integrate (incorporate) everything you've learned so far in your actions. Start charming women. Compliment them. Use their names. (That nice girl who works at McDonalds look her in the eyes and make her feel your manhood. You have all your seduction-tools with you so she's all yours. Not all yours but somebody else's ? So steal her away by being the kind of guy she would want her boyfriend to be. You can do it! See it as a complex equation. In order to solve it you have to know how the system of solving the equation works. You already know how the system works for seduction because you've spend nights reading the data on this website. Once you've solved tens of equations of that sort you start to see through how the fundamentals works. I mean seduce one girl and keep doing it and you'll be a master in seducing and you could eventually seduce any girl you'd want. It gets easier every time.) Use kino on them. Touch them. Melt them with your charm. ButGet in the process. Get involved. Imagine that you're opening a bar. First you're like "euhhhmm where am I supposed to order glasses? Where do I find people to hire? Where do print flyers for events?" You'll have many more questions. Until you start hanging around this guy or girl who already owns a bar. Soon he/she tells you one or two things and you go like "Okay I'll start with this" and when time comes and you have all the connections you need you can even grow more succesfull than your opponents and you'll start giving advice to them.Get acquainted with the girls you like and flirt with them. Jump in the water and go with the flow. Flow with the flow. Remember your sister (in-law) getting pregnant? Before that it was like there was not any pregnant woman walking on the face of this planet. But when you had a pregnant woman in your family suddenly it seemed like there were pregnant women everywhere. What I mean is: Get In The Process. Get involved.Example:After college I became low-profile (not at the surface) and a friend of mine who's a real arsehole started to annoy me with I'm-more-experienced-than-you-are-in-everything-sh*t . I was this very nice guy to everyone (not the nice guy on Pook's scale but just a nice guy in low-profile mode) who never tried push some in his shadow. But the bucket got full. No one who doesn't really know me has the right to judge me and make fun out of me. I started to act in the open again. One day I started charming every girl I know and in a couple of weeks I ended up with more girls interested in me than I was in them. My God there was a moment I saw myself as a sexsymbol. Me, of all people. I even got popular (more popular than him) with a girl he was in love with. I started getting popular with the friends of my so-called friend (I'll refer to him as c*nt) and next thing c*nt tells me is that he's jealous of all these girls showing me attention. Sometimes c*nt pops with his jealousy and tries to f*ck up my day but I hit him and he shuts up. Don't misunderstand me. I don't like humiliating people. I don't like showing off. I share things I know/have. I hate people who keep whining like little girls. I hate people who think they can press the juice out of me. I hate people who work on my nerve (I'm one of the most patient guys in the world.) I don't like revenge that much but my message was "Nobody fu(shwing!!!)cks with me" (don't read the shwing!!! part.)So I got in the process of being a Don Juan because I was trying to make myself clear. I learned that once you start using what you've learned and keep going on doing it, your investment pays off. Just like with stockholding.No quote this time unless you want to listen to My Way (Frank Sinatra) and study the lyrics.

    Buried Alive 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Let me tell you something : if you associate enough pain and sadness to the following exercise, hesitation will no longer be in your vocabulary. If you do this with all your might, say goodbye to fear. You won't be afraid of taking a risk and start your own business. You won't be afraid to walk across a crowded room to ask for a phone number from a beautiful women. You will refuse to let your dreams die and haunt you as regrets on your death bed. You won't be afraid to be rejected on your first initial trials. You will refuse to become just another name on a tombstone.Now let's do this.It will only take 15 minutes of your time.This is called to "buried alive" exercise. Now you have to be totally dedicated to perform that exercise. This is not for the timid souls. It will fill your body with the most painful emotions a human being can feel : the fear of death (or, if you prefer, the fear of life...), and the fear of regret... the feeling that you have led a meaningless, sad, boring life. Hopefully, after the exercise, you will realize that you are not dead after all. You will realize that you are still young, and that the world out there is a world of possibilities. Millions of possibilities. Hopefully, you will no longer fear to be adventurous and take risk because you fear rejection or because you could lose your comfortable but boring way of living. You will know IN YOUR GUT, NOT INTELLECTUALLY, that the greatest pain of all is dying and being haunted by your regrets, by the fear which provides comfort while stealing the essence of life : adventure, the unknown, women you can no longer kiss and hug, etc.Now let's do this.Lie down and relax. Cross your arms on your chest as if you were a dead body, ready to be buried.Imagine all the details of your burial, as if it took place tomorrow morning. The only difference is that you are buried alive. Now, as the story unfolds (church, prayers, cemetery, you know what I'm saying, you've all seen that before...) tighten all your muscles in a desperate effort to move. But don't move. IMAGINE ALL THE DETAILS (people you love, the flowers in your coffin, etc...). MAKE IT REAL. Now think of all the women you have never talked to. Why? Yeah, thats right : FEAR. Look at all your regrets and feel how much they weigh on your life. Know that theres nothing you cant do about it. Nobody can hear you. You are buried alive. I also want you to know that even if you could live one more week on this earth, you would probably remain the exact same person. Feel the pain of knowing that fear was stronger than you. Fear of rejection controlled your existence. But now its too late. *** FEEL THE PAIN ***. PAIN IS CRUCIAL. Remember. We don't want to have an intellectual experience here. This is worth nothing. We want a gut level feeling that will change your life forever. How will you know when the experience in intense enough? Simple When you are crying silently in your room. I know this is not an easy task. But an intellectual experience means nothing when we are faced with real life situations. Only a gut level experience will change the way you deal with fear. Now, when you cant take it anymore, break the lid of your coffin with your whole body and scream like you never screamed before. (Now if you did this correctly, you wont care about what people will think when they hear you screaming like a mad man. Who cares! You are alive!)This is a new birth for you.Breathe.Now, take out a sheet of paper and write down all the things you will no longer accept in your life. This is a fresh start for you. "Wow! That was a cool exercise! ".No, this could be your reality. We never know. I could be dead tomorrow. You could die tomorrow. THESE TRAGEDIES HAPPEN EVERYWHERE, EVERYDAY. WILL YOU LET FEAR TAKE YOUR LIFE BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY DIE?Now dont post replies to this thread if you havent done the exercise in the first place. As I said before, this is a GUT LEVEL exercise. If you just read this post, you have experienced 0.00000000000001 % pain compared to the real experience.I wish you adventure.I wish you peace.I wish you freedom.------------------Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.- Roosevelt[This message has been edited by CHALENGE GUY (edited 05-28-2001).]

Alright guys - listen up:Tired of these bytchez giving you the runaround?  Tired of getting used & abused?  Tired of feeling like a doormat?Here's what you gotta do - 1)  Realize there's a million women out there.  Hey - if one don't work out, it's NOT THE END OF THE WORLD - there's other fish out there!2)  Realize that 90% of the women out there are selfish little snakes that love toying with a guy's emotions.  Yep - it's true - you'd better watch yer a$$!3)  Keep things simple and basic.  Hey - the bottom line is, if they're truly interested in you, then they will SHOW it.  Any flaky stuff should raise a red flag in your head.4)  Listen to your gut.  He's the best friend you'll ever have!  Next time you get that 'niggly' feeling, stop, sit down and THINK about the situation.5)  Deal with reality.  Stop wondering if 'Does she like me???' - don't sit and WONDER so damn much.  Take it for what it is, and go with that.  No more 'What if's'!!6)  Don't put up with their bullsh!t.  This is VERY important!  Hey - if you don't like what she's doing, then CALL HER ON IT and don't let her get away with it!  And NO APOLOGIES!!!!!!!!!!7)  Hold them accountable for their actions.  What did she just tell you?  What, that she just wants to be friends?  Okay, fair is fair.  Tell her you don't want to be friends, and you're going to date someone else, and goodbye!  DO NOT HANG ONTO THEM! MAKE THEM PAY FOR THEIR MISTAKES - SAY 'GOODBYE'!!!  I can't tell you how important this is - most women are so spoiled and always get their way!!!  Let them experience the consequences of their stupid decisions!!!  How else are they gonna learn???!!!8)  Take what women say with a grain of salt.  Talk is SH!T.  Any questions?9)  Don't EVER give up your ground.  Stand up for what you believe in - I don't care if she's a 9 or a 10!!!  Does that make them anymore special than you?  HELL NO!!!10)  Just say "No Ma'am" to losers.  Drop them IMMEDIATELY.11)  MOST IMPORTANTLY:  There's a few good ones out there.  Don't EVER forget this!!!Guys, remember this - when push comes to shove, they need us more than we need them.  Don't believe me?  Here's proof:  How many girls do you know that have a boyfriend?  Now, how many guys do you know that have a girlfriend?  'Nuff said.F' em - they're no better than us.  So stop treating them like they are!  Only when she has proven to you time and again that she is truly a diamond among fly sh!t should we lavish our attention upon her!!!

    "LOVE" is a four letter word: the MASTER of all advice posts 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


   I just wanna share what I've concluded through not only my own experiences but also from this board and Doc Love, who is unquestionably the genius of relationship advice for men.     I think we all grow up in this culture that idealizes "being in love": the sappy valentine's day routine, bringing your girl flowers with the cliched poems ("roses are red, violets are blue...").  So we all TRY to FALL IN LOVE when we meet a girl that we have the tiniest inkling that we like...WE TRY TO FORCE THE NEW RELATIONSHIP INTO A SAPPY ROMANCE STRAIGHT OUT OF THE MOVIES!  And all this ends up doing is driving away your girl and breaking your heart, leaving you bitter and depressed.  SOLUTION: We have to realize life isn't a movie: just cause we may like a girl after a first date, or even after three, it DOESN'T mean she's good enough to be serious relationship material.  Think of it as an interview to an EXTREMELY prestigious and important position: would you let some applicant who came in and had a good first interview immediately take the reins of a Fortune 500 company? Of course not!  So why let your new girl have the prestigous position of "Your Woman" so easily??  1) By realizing this, you will automatically play a challenge and stimulate her interest enough to create a relationship so you can see if you two are right for each other.  If you don't, you'll drive her off so quickly that you'll never know if the two of you were to be.2) You avoid the pathetic cycle of falling hard for a new girl, leading to getting all sappy on her and smothering her, leading to her leaving you without the slightest bit of guilt and you feeling like your world has just ended.

From Cliff's seduction newsletter:Sisonpyh:Hey guys, it's been a little while since I've posted anything, so I'm goingto make up for it again with a long one...I've been busy lately working on, of all things, writing a book.Cliff told me to mention it here (thanks Cliff).I have a website now called www.doubleyourdating.com  where I offer it if,you'd like to come check it out -- and I'll tell you more about it at theend of this post.Onward.Because I've been interacting with a lot of guys who have been buying mybook, I've been realizing some things that I never thought about before.I have to start and frame this by telling you about a couple of commonbusiness strategies. I think I've mentioned that I've done a lot of work inmarketing. Here's something that is very common:Most small businesses make a HUGE mistake when they begin their marketingcampaigns... they look at big companies who are making millions and then tryto COPY what those big companies are doing. This makes sense logically. Theowners of these new small companies are saying "Hey, if it works for them,then it will work for me. I'll just copy the best and get the same results."Well, you might have heard that approximately 96% of new businesses GO OUTof business.The problem with copying the big boys is that it takes a different marketingstrategy to GROW a business than it does to MAINTAIN a business once it hasbecome successful.The question that small business owners SHOULD be asking is "When thatsuccessful business was brand new, what kind of marketing did it do toBECOME successful?"Are you with me here? Instead of looking at what big businesses are doingNOW, they should be looking at what the big business DID when it was new inorder to grow.This metaphor seems to translate over to men who are learning to besuccessful with women.Guys who are new to the idea of learning how to meet women often look atwhat the killer pick up artists are doing and try to copy them.I remember when I started out... I was all fascinated with getting phonenumbers, learning slick lines, and all of the psychology.Now, there's nothing wrong with learning from pros... I give credit to myfriends who have helped me learn the skills that I have... BUT, and it's abig one...I think that most guys should be asking the pros "What did you do when youSTARTED learning this stuff to get to the point where you are now?"I like to ask things like "When you first started learning to approachwomen, what did you do to overcome the fear of rejection?"That question will get you a lot further than "What do you say to a womanwhen you meet her?"Does this make sense to you? It's useful to study the structure andprogression of how the pros learned and grew - more so than just asking whatthey do now.By the way, you'll find a lot of the times you ask a killer pick-up artistthese types of "How did you learn this..." and "What did you do when youstarted..." they will remember things that they've long since forgottenabout.You'll get answers like "Wow, I completely forgot about this... but when Istarted, the first thing I did was go out to a shopping mall and talk towomen who were selling men's clothing... because I knew I could try thingsand they had to talk to me..." etc.With that said, I'm going to tell you about some more of my perspectives onhow to become great with women... I call this:"Six Critical Mistakes Men Make With Women... And What To Do About It"(That's my marketing side coming out... ha) I've taken this idea of "Whatshould a guy do when he's learning?" and built what you're about to read.Some of it is theory, and some is technique. I hope you enjoy.Mistake #1: GIVING AWAY THEIR POWER TO OTHERSGerry Spence, in his amazing book "How To Argue And Win Every Time" (The 2tape series is the best) talks about the idea of giving your power away toothers.When you let the idea of a woman rejecting you stop you from walking overand talking to her, you're GIVING AWAY YOUR POWER.When you allow what someone says about you to affect your mood and selfesteem, you're GIVING AWAY YOUR POWER.A lot of people have a strategy which involves linking their self-image andself-esteem to things that they IMAGINE, and to events that happen outsideof them (i.e. rejection by a woman).This is also giving away power to others.When I first started, I sat down and did a bit of rational thinking aboutdifferent situations with women.I asked myself questions like:"If a woman rejects me in public, right in front of 50 people, what will theeffect be on me and my life?""If I go to kiss a woman, and she pushes me away, what is the worst thingthat can happen?""If I call a woman, and she's rude to me on the phone, what will the resultbe?"Then I listed what the WORST possible outcomes could be. I mean things like"Well, if she rejects me, my friends could laugh at me and everyone couldthink I'm a dork..."I thought of every result that I could.Then I asked myself "Can I live with that?" and "Will that actually hurt mein any way?"Now, I'll tell you, it was hard for me to admit to myself that I was afraid.I didn't like the idea that I was afraid of women and what they thought ofme.But when I finally admitted it to myself, and started rationally thinking ofwhat the worst case scenarios would be and, MORE IMPORTANTLY IF I COULD LIVEWITH THEM a lot started to happen.I realized that if a woman rejected me, that I'D GET OVER IT. I'd actuallylive.I realized that the first few times it happened it might be a littletraumatic, but by preparing myself to deal with whatever happened, it gaveme the courage to go out and try some things (more on that later).In summary: Don't give away your power. Keep your power for you. If you haveto, face your fear internally, resolve to handle the worst case scenario,then get on with TAKING ACTION.Mistake #2: NOT LEARNING TO MANAGE THEIR EMOTIONSHere's the deal: Most of the guys I have met and talked to have some kind of'automatic' emotional reactions that come up for them when it comes tomeeting women... and most of the time, the automatic reactions aredestroying their success.I personally think that it's quite natural for a guy to get all excited whenhe meets a woman that's attractive to him. It charges the body and makes youfeel alive.But the problem is that it also 1) Often prevents a guy from taking action,saying hi, or whatever because his fear level rises, and 2) Often makes thatguy start acting unnatural when he finally does get the balls to starttalking... can I hear an AMEN?I assume that by being on this list you have probably had at least someexperience with NLP, Hypnosis, Huna, etc.These are all great ways to learn to manage your emotions.The problem is that most guys don't actually take the time to learn andpractice the techniques that these disciplines teach in order to get theirsituation handled.I used to get all kinds of freaked out when I thought of walking up andtalking to a woman. This would usually prevent me from even trying, as Ifelt like I'd screw it up.It took me awhile to learn how to chill a bit, but when I finally did, I wasable to be about 10x as effective. I actually enjoy a little bit of thatrush that happens when I see a woman that I'm about to go meet. It feelsgood. But too much can really throw me off.So I use a couple of exercises that I learned from Timeline Therapy to chillmy emotions.If I need to calm down quickly, or to stay calm, I just imagine going allthe way into the future on my timeline and then looking back to now... thenquickly snapping back to the present moment. I do this about three times ina row, all in about 2 seconds. This works great for me.Now, here's the kicker: I had to try a couple of dozen things to find thisone. And I had to try it a few ways in order to get it to work for me.I'd recommend getting some note cards an writing down 10 exercises to calmyou down or make you stay calm, then go out where there are hot women,imagine walking up and talking to one, then read a card and try theexercise.Read "Feel The Fear And Do It Anyway" by Jeffers, "Frogs Into Princes" byBandler and Grinder, and "The Secret Of Creating Your Future" by James forideas.Mistake #3: NOT REALIZING THAT IT ALL COMES DOWN TO A FEW KEY MOMENTS AND AFEW CRITICAL SKILLSOne of the things that learning all of this stuff about how to meet womenhas made me realize is that there are a few major points in any "seduction"that stump most guys.I've made a list of 10, and I call them "Critical Moments." These are:1. Approach (Walking over and saying hello)2. Digits (Getting a phone number, email address, etc.)3. Date request (This can actually be done when you first meet)4. Date (The actual time with her)5. Hold hands (The first sustained physical contact)6. Kiss (The first 'intimate' contact)7. Alone in private (Trust)8. Make out (Sexually aroused)9. Clothes off (Very sexually aroused)10. Sex (Very very very sexually aroused!)I'd say that somewhere around 90-95% of the questions that I get about howto meet women are in one of these 10 areas.I'd bet that if you're having trouble, it fits into one of these categories.I don't get a lot of guys writing me to say "What kind of car impresseswomen most?" or "What kind of cologne should I wear?" These are finequestions, but they're not the killer stumping points.The interesting thing about the Critical Moments is that each usuallyREQUIRES THE MAN TO TAKE ACTION AND RISK REJECTION.In each of these moments, the woman is usually perceived to have all thepower. If she stops the game, it's over.This makes a lot of guys feel pretty weak and powerless.In martial arts, it takes months of practice to prepare for a tournamentthat lasts minutes. With women, each of these Critical Moments usuallypasses in a few minutes or seconds. These moments don't make up very much ofthe time that you're usually together with her, but they are the KEYS towhether the relationship will go to a physical level.In any event, I realized that I REALLY DON'T LIKE REJECTION. I don't reallysee a need for it... I don't think that it's necessary to invite it into mylife.So I asked myself "How do I get past all of these Critical Moments with aMINIMUM of even the possibility of rejection?"My answer is what I call my "Bridges." I've created techniques for settingup each moment that make it very natural for the woman to continue through,and many times, even INITIATE it.If you've read my past posts, you know about some of my ideas and techniquesaround getting email addresses and phone numbers, teasing, turning women on,etc.For instance, if you ask a woman for her phone number, you have a situationwhere you could get a rejection... on the other hand if you ask "Do you haveemail?" most women will say "Yes" at which point you can take out a pen andjust pretend that she also meant "Yes I'll give it to you..."This works like a charm... and while she's writing her email you just say"And write your number there too..."This little "Bridge" will up your results by 50-100% or more if you useit... and it's so simple.My suggestion for you is to organize what you've learned from differentsources and create your own set of Bridges to get you past the points thatyou're having trouble with.By preparing for these SPECIFIC moments, you'll increase your successdramatically.Mistake #4: NOT IMPROVING THEMSELVES IN THE AREA OF PHYSICAL APPEARANCE FROMAN 'OBJECTIVE' PERSPECTIVEMost of the guys that I know who are great at picking up women are notmodel-handsome.Most of them are not tall.Most of them are not millionaires.Most are not famous.But almost ALL of them pay attention to how they look, and they do theirbest to present themselves well when they meet women.Now, I don't think that you have to start spending $500.00 on t-shirts andbuild a Muscle Media body.I honestly believe that most women (Yes, even the super hot ones) are moreinterested in your personality in the long run.BUT, I also believe that if you look BAD, you're going to cause women topre-judge you too much and ruin your chances.A few pointers:- Neat, stylish, well kept hair- Little or no facial hair, no uni-brow, etc.- Clean, non-wrinkled clothing that fit you well- Nice, clean shoes and belt (matching)- Very clean face and body (wash whole body a MINIMUM of three times eachshower)- Neat and clean hands, fingernails, feet, toes, etc.- ***BIG ONE: The teeth! Make sure they're clean, flossed, and no bad breathEVER!Now, you might have to actually spend a little while learning a few thingsabout style and fashion.I personally wear a lot of Calvin Klein t-shirts (untucked) with nice blackjeans, and nice black leather square-toe shoes (Nordstrom Rack for $50).This whole getup can be had for about a hundred bucks or so... and it worksjust about anywhere from Starbucks to a club.Do yourself a favor and make the best of what you have. Even if you're notBrad Pitt, you can still look your best.Mistake #5: NOT IMPROVING THEIR COMMUNICATION SKILLS, VOICE TONE, ANDPERSONALITY TO BECOME MORE ATTRACTIVE TO WOMENA lot of guys that I talk to are just not willing to change the way thatthey communicate.If you have a weak, high pitched voice... lowering it and speaking moredeeply will make you more attractive to most women.If you have nervous ticks, it will help you to practice not doing them -they make women nervous.If you have no sense of humor, it will help you to cultivate one (this is abig one, guys).I get a lot of guys that don't want to change... they just want things tohappen for them.Summed up, it goes like this: Some guys would rather be 'themselves' than besuccessful.I'm not suggesting that you sacrifice your unique individuality here, I'mjust saying that there are ways you can improve yourself, that won't makeyou an ass-kisser, that will make you more successfulSo get yourself a tape series on how to improve your voice. Read about howto calm yourself down so you're not nervous. Get a couple of books on comedy(I love Comedy Writing Secrets by Helitzer).Go down to the bookstore and look at the 'Communication Skills' section.If you keep working on improving your basic communication skills, you'llkeep improving with women.Mistake #6: GIVING UP TOO EARLY OR NOT EVEN TRYING IN THE FIRST PLACEHave you noticed on this list that a lot of guys argue with an idea beforethey try it? Or they discredit someone else's idea and say that theirs isbetter?Guys love to say "That won't work" or "I tried that and it doesn't work"...Many times, this leads to a negative attitude that prevents them from eventrying other things... or of not trying something again that didn't work thefirst time.I think that it's important to test new things at least 3-5 times, and maybemore.The first times I approached women weren't very smooth... I didn't get theirnumbers or whatever.The problem wasn't the lines I was using or the techniques... it was mydelivery.I can walk up to any woman and open up a conversation with just aboutANYTHING now... I have tried all kinds of crazy openers just to see if they'll work.Now that I have some skills, things that didn't work before work for me now.So I recommend that if you like an idea, try it a bunch of times.If it doesn't work for you now, try it again in 3 months. Keep trying newideas and new things until you find things that work TOGETHER. Remember, it's a system of different things working together that will get you the resultthat you want.Now, some people have the problem that they won't try new things in thefirst place... they're just too set in their ways.I like to ALWAYS try new ways of doing things.If I'm driving home, I'll try to drive a new way. If I'm explainingsomething, I try explaining it two ways, if I'm ordering food, I try newthings.This mindset of trying new things leads to an open mind, and an attitude of"Hey, here's how that might work... I'll try it" rather than one of "Here'swhat's wrong with that idea."If you find yourself arguing with every idea before you try it, then it'sprobably a good idea for you to start messing up your routines in life andstart trying new things in all areas... it will help you in THIS area.OK, my fingers are tired.More about my new book: If you come to my website at www.doubleyourdating.com  you can read about it. I've written a book that'sabout 90 pages long and three bonus booklets that are each about 10 pages.I've expanded all of my ideas and explained them in detail, and I've beengetting some great feedback on it.

    Next time you're too scared to approach do this.. 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Earlier this year, a workmate of mine and myself were talking about how we constantly bomb out of picking up women we like simply because we get to shyt scared to make the initial approach.Then we talked about how much worse we feel for not doing and my mate coined the phrase during one of our conversations "Man, I feel so much like shyt I hit the steering wheel when i'm driving just thinking how stupid I am."And that's something that struck me. Not approaching a girl actually feels worse than getting rejected. So I swore to myself that next time I was starting to scare myself into not speaking/approaching a girl I would remind myself not to "hit the steering wheel" either...i'd use it as my mantra to motivate myself to get rid of my fears and pressure myself into making an approach.Just by saying that, I jog my memory to the feelings of angst of not picking up or at least trying....not making an effort is the act of a true loser. And I didnt want to be one.Now whenever I start that churning in my stomach and LoserJoey starts trying to convince me to not do anything - I just think to myself "DOnt hit the steering wheel on this one." and I hear the words come out of my mouth..."Hi, my name's Joe, what's yours?"[This message has been edited by DonJoey (edited 08-07-2001).]

    <h3>
    How to be Happy 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


These are the principles I use to be happy.  They work for me, and I hope they work for you  HOW TO BE HAPPY1) Give more than you receiveBeing generous makes me happy because it makes me feel like I'm overflowing with good things.  I give more than I receive because I have so much to give to other people that it would make me burst if I didn't give some of it away.  And I love putting a smile on a glum person's face.2) Don't keep scoreI don't think of life as a game with winners and losers.  I think of it as a canvas that I'm painting, a book I'm writing.  Sure, there are winners and losers out there, but I don't waste time on adding up numbers to figure out how far I'm ahead or behind.  What's the point?  I put the same amount of time into just getting ahead.3) Hold the GrooveThis is a tricky one.  Call if the Funk, the groove, the beat, call it Jah, call it Ra, call it the Great Magnet, call it God, but whatever you call it, have it--not a deity, but a something that makes the day flow as smooth as a river.  I love swaying my body rhythmically and listening to mix CDs of my favorite songs, whether I'm on the dance floor or on the street.  I love walking down the street, playing music on the turntable inside my head, and grooving with the beat.  I literally could not make myself feel bad in any way while doing this, no matter how hard I tried.4) Treat time as a friendI don't watch the clock.  I try not to live my life by the clock.  I play hooky from my social engagements when I feel like it.  I make sure to call in sick every now and then for no reason.  I gave away all my timepieces a while back, and it feels good.  (If I really need to know the time I just ask one of the million people out there with watches).  There's no pressure on me anymore, because the perceived length of each day now depends entirely on how I choose to spend it.5) Be an optimistUnlike pessimism, optimism can't hurt.  Everybody knows the benefits of optimism.  In short, I used to be a pessimist, and when I look back on that part of my life now I just shake my head with disbelief at how pointless my pessimism was.  I love optimism and the feelings it generates.6) Shake things upTake risks.  Do things differently, or do things that make no sense at all.  I love taking pointless trips to places around the country, all by myself.  There's nothing like the freedom of being alone and free in a strange city, with a million places you've never seen before in your life waiting for you to explore them, and a million people out there for you to meet.  No obligations.  No deadlines.  Just me, my mind, a pad and pen, and a bunch of new experiences.7) Exercise your mindI try to always keep myself busy with some new project or idea or experience, and preferably two or three at the same time.  I get very happy when I finish a project and rest just long enough to move on to another one.  When my mind is busy working on something I am interested in, I am happy.8) Work your bodyI run and do simple push-ups every day to get the juices flowing.  Like most people, I'm very happy when exhausted at the end of a good workout.  If I skip exercising for a few days, I start to feel like a piece of stale moldy cheese, but when I exercise regularly I feel strong as a bull.9) Smile and laugh a lotIt's self-explanatory, and it works.10) "Specialize in having fun"Thanks must go to Jim Morrison for the idea.  It's a line from a song on the album The Doors.  Anytime I have a lot of fun I try to figure out what got me there.  What got me there once will get me there again, any time I please.  There is an art to having fun, but I'm only beginning to discover this (and that's where the fun lies).It's been good to be alive ever since I figured this stuff out!  I hope it helps.

    Change your life today 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Change your life by changing the small things you do.This is what i've started and my day has a different ring to it.1. I wake up an hour earlier each day (I loved sleeping in and being late to work each day)2. Now that i'm awake earlier, I've started walking and jogging for 30 minutes every morning.This makes me feel great, invigorated in two ways - I've managed to action an idea I had (to walk/jog in the morning), and i'm being physically better for it (I wanna tone up before the Australian summer).3. By getting up earlier, I dont have an excuse to get to work late, in fact i've been getting in before everyone else.I now feel better in that (even though I hate my job at the moment), i'm sticking it to the other staff here by beating them in, i'm also having more free time by finishing stuff earlier - no interruptions when no-one is here which mean more www.sosuave.com  time.4. I'm losing more weight by walking/jogging - which means i've decided to eat better. I'm looking better, and by looking better i'm feeling better about myself.It doesnt change my looks, what matters is that i'm happy I look better.Now that I feel i'm looking better, i'm happier and I feel more confident about MYSELF. No-one else.5. With all this confidence about myself, I dont seem to care that much what other people think at the moment. I feel like i'm my own man with a mission (dont know what the mission is yet, but i'm laying the foundation for something BIG), and I act like it.6. With this look of a man on a mission, people are taking notice. Workmates, friends etc. I look like I have ambition, I look like i'm happy, I look like i've got a lot to offer and I really dont look like I need anyone.7. With this look I'm now portraying, people want to get to know me, not everyone wants to know me for long - i'm still a human and I still have my flaws - part of being a perfect man is to have flaws. So not everyone is interested in me, but alot of people are. But that doesnt matter, as I dont care what other people think of me. I'm happy being myself.8. So being happy with being myself, i've decided to start accomplishing other stuff i've kept putting off, and by doing this - i've increased my confidence in myself (is there anything I CANT DO? - I just installed a new kitchen in my house with no instructions and I have no carpentry skills! - and yeaas, it does look good, just like the catalogue)There are still heaps I have to do with my life for me to consider it lived worthwhile with no regrets. Many things I want to try.But i've made a small start...a simple start, I decided I was going to wake up an hour earlier and go for a jog and walk.The little things you do lead to bigger things, and its the little things you plan that are easier to start on.Start on something new today, no matter how small - but its gotta be somthing you've been putting off for a long time. Then watch your enthusiasm and confidence in yourself grow as you accomplish it.[This message has been edited by DonJoey (edited 08-12-2001).]

    <h3>
    On rejection 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. --Michael JordanIt is common knowledge that pick-up's are a numbers game. The first girl says no, the second says yes. What is important in the game is bouncing back. A rejection can really hurt. The ego, depending on how fragile it is can become damaged. The good news is that you can bounce back it may take minutes, hours...even days or months. Even the best Pick up artist is not always on top of his game. Using his best field proven lines and tactics sometimes does not work for the master pick up artist. The difference between a regular pick up artist and the master is that the master always bounces back. When a basketball player goes to take a shot he feels that it will go in (or at least he tries to get it in). Sometimes they miss. The great players shut out the misses and concentrate on scoring. How can you score when you doubt yourself and your abilities?Injury is common in the game. You are going to get hurt. All pick up artists know this. Risk, pain and injury are part of the game. Can you imagine how many times Michael Jordan was knocked to the hardwood floor, or elbowed in the face? How many times has he in addition to missing the lay-up come down hard in the paint? He and other great players just get up and limp down to the other end of the court, waiting to get a chance to try again. The greats know that when they go on court that they might get hurt but they still play hard. The greats play to win.I went to a club recently and the first 2 girls who I asked to dance said "No".The third girl who I asked said, "Yes" and we danced together all night. What if I had stopped after the first 2 "no's" and gone home? I would have missed out on the "Yes".Courage is being scared to death--and saddling up anyway.--John WayneCourage is an essential part of a DJ's arsenal. Without courage there is no approach. It's like seeing the hoop and being afraid to take the shot. In the pick up you either get a yes or a no. You have to have the courage to take the shot. If it is a no you have to have the courage to continue with the game.Always go for the goal. If you miss, don't worry they'll always be another shot.------------------http://www.deardiary.net/cgi-bin/viewer.cgi?diary=3874

    <h3>
    Change Your Perspective 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Life is simply a matter of perspective. There are 6 billion individuals on Earth, and each one has their own unique view on life - their own perspective. A certain event can have a totally different meaning, depending on how you perceive it. For example: cutting down forests for wood. This is going to be bad news if you're an environmentalist, but it'll be a great thing if you're the owner of the logging company cutting the trees.How does this help us?The great thing about our perspectives is that we are able to CHANGE them if we desire to. We can change our beliefs on a certain subject if we wish, and will see things in a totally different way. We can use this to overcome any fears and anxieties we face when we want to meet that certain someone. How?If we are afraid of making an initial approach, and the whole concept of introducing yourself to a woman seems like a tedious chore - we can convince ourself that it is FUN. We ENJOY the rush we get by putting ourselves out there. We WANT to do it again and again. Say it to yourself OVER AND OVER until it sinks in. This idea can be applied to any situation where confidence is something we don't have enough of.If a lie is repeated long enough, it begins to be accepted. Once the lie is accepted, it is as good as truth in our minds. Try it. Convince yourself you like doing the things you normally feared. It will work if you BELIEVE you can do it.Good Luck.------------------The Human Body Is A Fragile Thing, But The Human Soul Can NEVER Be Truly Broken.

    Becoming a True Don Juan 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Sorry I hadn't posted in a while,busy making my 100th post!!! Woo hoo! Here it is!Many people on this site were nerds at one point in life. It wasnt fun, and I know from personal experience. The problem with most people seeking advice is that they expect to find a bunch of pick-up lines and techniques that they must memorize. This is true about most websites. This is not one of those websitesAs Pook put it so well in his previous post, Kill that Desperation (this is the first post of the DJ Bible, which I have studied extensively over the weekend) quote: Being a Don Juan is not a net sum of smooth maneuvers and methods but of your own outlook on the world and on women. ANYONE can memorize 'techniques', but FEW can change the way HOW they think.A Don Juan is a state of mind, not a list of methods and tricks. This is truly the hardest challenge to becoming a true Don Juan. Changing the way you think so that it comes naturally.First well focus on your faults. Write them ALL down. Every single one you can think of. Now find a solution to each problem. Now get out there and fix those problems. So youre a scrawny son of a b*tch. Solution: go work out three times a week. Dont just write it out, go DO the things you wrote. If you give up, the problem is never going to be solved! Simple as that! If you want to gain more confidence, talk to at least three new people every week (preferably the chicks  ). If you bail out because youre afraid of rejection, youve already ruined it for yourself. You have rejected yourself. The problem is never going to be fixed this way and then we have all these assholes posting that the techniques never work. They complain that it is just too much work and that they still feel like losers. If you ever say it is too much work, you are the biggest f*ck*ng loser on the face of the earth. You must change this way of thinking. The only way this site will help you is if you apply the confidence boosters, attitude changers, and conversation tips to your everyday life. This website is all about helping yourself by using others experiences. If you do not apply any of these posts, articles, tips, and techniques to your life and learn from experience, then youre right, these techniques WONT work. Why? Because the only way to learn is through personal experience.Now here are the basics to changing the way you think and becoming a more confident and successful individual with women.Learn to love yourselfRespect yourself and you will gain the respect of othersGo gain some experienceChange your attitude towards womenWork on it until it comes naturallyIn the end, a Don Juan isnt just someone who attracts the ladies. Its all about improving upon yourself. Youre not going to get anyone to like you if you dont love yourself! Nobodys going to respect you if you dont show some respect for yourself! If you dont get any experience, how are you ever going to learn what works and what doesnt?! Nobody should ever be above you. You shouldnt be after women; they should be the ones dying to be near you! If they reject you its their f*ck*ng loss DAMN IT! Dont ever give a sh*t about what people think! You are not a f*ck*ng doormat that everybodys going to walk all over! You are a human being and you deserve respect. Dont put up with chicks who treat you like sh*t. Youre worth more than that. Once youve become a doormat, the chicks will see you as someone to take advantage of you become the dreaded nice guy quote: Pook: The KEY to killing desperation (and attracting crowds ofwomen) is to THINK and BELIEVE that you are The GreatCatch.and nice guys always finish last.Now being a nice guy isnt bad, just dont let it go too far. Once people start using you as a doormat, they wont stop until you change your ways and learn to say NO! They will constantly disrespect you by using you, and they will continue to do so for the rest of your life until you lose that nice guy way of thinking. You often dont realize it but people will test you every day! When a chick asks you to do something like throw a paper away for her, she is testing you to see if you will be useful to her. Now if her pencil falls under your desk, okay. Thats different. You can easily pick up the pencil and give it to her or at least kick it to her desk. But asking you for a dollar to buy herself a drink?! Asking you to throw a paper away just because she is too lazy (not to be confused with too busy) to throw it away herself?! Your time is just as precious as hers! Next time you are treated like her pawn by being asked to throw away her paper, get her a chair, etc. tell her with a cocky smirk on your face that she can manage. Remind her that you are very busy and cannot stop to do her work just because she doesnt want to do it herself. Remember to actually have something to do though, you should ALWAYS have something to do. Not doing anything is a waste of time and people will think that you have no life. Bored on a weekend? Go running or ride your bike. Learn to play the guitar. Figure out a new trick on a skateboard. Do SOMETHING!Now changing how you think can be pretty hard. It takes time, experience, and determination. You have to focus on what youre trying to improve until it becomes natural. This is the key to changing how you think! Do it until it comes naturally! Once youve got it down you wont think about it anymore! Its like typing. First you have to look down at the keys, then you try it without looking, and once youve got the hang of it, youre not even going to wonder about what key you need to press because itll all come naturally. Heres another example: conversations. The hardest thing about conversing is actually having to listen. Listening is not a natural man thing. First you have to focus on what theyre saying and consciously look for clues as to what you may say to her next (Those are some really interesting shoes. Where did you buy them? So you say youve lived in Florida? Whats it like over there? or Ive been to Florida, its a really nice place. Did you check out any of the beaches? etc., etc., etc). Pretty soon listening will become a subconscious act. Youll pick up on little clues to keep the conversation going naturally.Another thing chicks love is a good sense of humor. If you dont have any funny people in your family, chances are your sense humor is going to suck as well. Dont lose hope though! If you want to brush up on you humor, go buy a comedy CD or video. Watch Comedy Central for a while. Watch it only if you think its funny. Thisll help you by learning some new jokes and youll also learn the art of timing. Timing what you say is what makes spontaneous humor so funny. Soon timing will come naturally! This applies to other things as well, what you put in is what will come out. The more humor listen to or watch, the funnier youll be. The more music you were exposed to as a child will determine if you will have any musical talent. The more books you read, the more extended your vocabulary. (I personally despise this tactic but an extended vocabulary makes you sound more intelligent and few words rarely used in a standard vocabulary can be used as a source for excellent humor. Did you notice how smart I sounded in that last sentence?   Yeah, those were some big words.) No, Green Eggs and Ham does not count  Remember that High School is supposed to be a learning experience. Practice you DJ techniques on the chicks. Youll pick up some bodacious babes along the way and once you figure out what works, you can apply it to the real world.The secret to becoming a true Don Juan is to constantly improve yourself. The only way to do that is through experience. The only way to get some experience is to get your ass out of your that and go Don Juanisize them (thanks Antonio  ).So what are you waiting for? Get your ass out there and make us all proud!Good luck soldier,DJ Bedford----------------------You are THE MAN. You must be IN CHARGE. Desperate guyswill try to be 'nice' in every which way to win the girl (and fail,of course). But Prince Charming and the Great Catch willSWEEP WOMEN OFF THEIR FEET. When you THINK you arethe goods, you realize that it is ridiculous to treat arelationship and flirting as walking on eggshells. YOU set therules, NOT the other way around. After all, YOU are the prizeto be sought.--Yet another great quote by Pook.~~~enjoy my 100th post. Just wait until I get to 200!

    To Anyone Who Lacks Confidence 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


By now you will have heard that confidence is the single most important thing you need when you try to meet and keep a woman. You have heard it over and over, but you cannot find it in yourself. You are puzzled, then you become sad. The one thing everyone says you need, you can't find. You know you need it. You srceam out "Where can I find my confidence?!?" Is it behind the fridge? Did I leave it on the bus?You are asking the wrong questions.What is confidence? It is a belief in yourself that you are capable of doing what you want/need to do. It is tightly tied with self-esteem and self-worth. Now you know WHAT it is, you can ask the BIG question you must have answered. "How do I get it?" Confidence is an attractive trait to have, but many people doubt themselves. They think to themselves "I can't get confidence. I can't do anything right." They become less and less familiar with confidence and lose sight of the big picture. They think negative. If they can think positive the they can feel better about themselves, but their minds tell them they have no good things to think about, and that they never will. If these people try hard they can think of good things they have done in the past when they were very happy, and start to think positive. The they begin to have faith in themselves, and they slowly gain confidence. FINALLY they have a chance to go out and make more good things happen to themselves and feel even better and even more confident. Once you start to feel confident you have to use it straight away, or it will disappear before you can benefit from it.Some people can't do it. They try and try, but can't find any happy memories. They begin to ask if there's another way - they ask "Do we need confidence? I've never been happy with myself???" There is another way to do it. These people can try to stop worrying about their bad memories, and not worry about trying to find a woman to have all their fun with. These people only need to have fun. They need to make themselves happy. A fun person is also attractive to other people. They may not be confident, but they are having fun. They get happy experiences. They can think positive. All of a sudden, they realise they HAVE happy memories, and CAN think positive, and CAN get their confidence!!!What sort of a person are YOU? If you are not confident in yourself, you can MAKE yourself confident. NOBODY ELSE CAN MAKE YOU CONFIDENT. YOU MUST DO IT ON YOUR OWN. When you try to do it, you have already started to win.------------------The Human Body Is A Fragile Thing, But The Human Soul Can NEVER Be Truly Broken.

    <h3>
    Winning And Losing 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Generally, guys seem to think that approaching women is all about winning or losing. Either you will get the girl interested in you and get a date/girlfriend/f*ck (win) or you will be rejected and/or embarrassed(lose). It's the way most guys see it, so that's just the way it is, right? Wrong. Winning and losing don't even come into it. It is all about one thing - experience. At the start, most (if not all) potential Don Juans will be rejected at one stage or another. This is not to be seen as losing! What it is really doing is teaching you the error of your ways, the mistakes you've made, and how to IMPROVE your methods. No amount of learning from this site (as great as it is) can prepare you for the reality of it. It sounds simple enough in print, but in person it can be a whole new game. You have to learn from your mistakes, and the mistakes of others if you hope to shed your AFC ways and improve your abilities to that of a truly great Don Juan.Eventually, a potential Don Juan will begin to see how things really work, and he will begin to (as AFC's will call it) start winning. This isn't an accurate way of seeing it either, although winning women over is always something fun to boast about to your (unsuccessful) mates. It, again, is a form of experience. The game is far from over. You still have to hold onto this woman and keep her interest in you at a maximum. If you're only after sex buddies, you still have to work hard to learn better ways to enjoy it better (for you and her), and still keep them coming back for more.  Even with success, the game is far from over!So when you're on the approach next time, keep in mind that regardless of what happens, you will not win or lose. You will gain experience which will help you hone your skills, and it is invaluable to you in the future - and that can be more important than a quick f*ck.------------------The Human Body Is A Fragile Thing, But The Human Soul Can NEVER Be Truly Broken.

    COURAGE 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Next time you see her, you will grab you balls and ask the damn phone number.I know.. you know. You will get scared. You will because youre not in the right mood Suddenly, thinking and believing you are the great catch will seem laughable and you will do what youve always done : nothing.No, you can no longer accept that kind of behavior.Next time you see her, no matter what happens, you will grab your balls and do ask her out. There are no excuses except these two1. You discover she has a bf, 2. She tells you to get the fukk out of her sight. You have to accept that this will probably feel ackward. You have to accept that you may get a "no" as an answer, or an unconvincing yes (which means no).But hell, you did it. The only downside is some colateral damage to your ego, but lets face it, if shes not interested, waiting to see what happens only means postponing the hurt. By being clear right away (" whats your phone number " = Im interested) you come off as a MAN. Not a boy. A MAN. A man who can grab his balls. And if the answer is no, you know you can always move on to other and better things : you are free again. Besides, the pain will disappear with time, and you know you can make it 30 seconds. This is nothing compared to the pride you will experience, because you had the guts to grab your balls and make a darn move. You dont have to wonder about her feelings anymore : you are a free man.Now lets imagine she is interested.Let me tell you something, shying away (or waiting to be in the right mood) will only decrease her interest level. It is your role to ask her out, not hers. Waiting means entering the dreaded zone where it feels ackward to ask her phone number because you both get mixed signals form each other. Yes, she moved on to other and better things. Worse off, you may even fall in the most putrid circle of Hell : the friend zone.Youre probably asking youself if she is interested. Shut up, brain. Just shut up and grab your balls. Asking the phone number will clear things up. It will either bring you an immense feeling of pride and liberation (if she says no) or a potential relationship. Whatever happens, you win.But one more thing I know you. You are still reviewing all her signals asking yourself if she likes you YES YOU MORON : SHE LIKES YOU!  LISTEN VERY WELL : SHE LIKES YOU. SHE WANTS YOU TO GRAB YOUR FUKKING BALLS AND MAKE A GODDAMMM MOVE. STOP WONDERING AND GO FOR IT OR I WILL CHASE YOU FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE AND KICK YOUR REAR TILL YOU DIE. THERE IS NO STRATEGY HERE, YOU PATHETIC CHUMP. LIFE IS A DEMOLITION DERBY : YOU JUST GOTTA GRAB YOUR FUKKING BALLS. THIS IS NO JOKE : IF YOU SHY AWAY, I WILL FIND YOU. I WILL GET MY REVENGE YOU FUKKING IDIOT.THIS IS THE OLD " YOU " TALKING, IM 70 YEARS OLDER AND I AM ON MY FUKKING DEATH BED. BECAUSE OF YOU AND YOUR GODDAMM SHYNESS, I LED A MISERABLE LIFE. I MISSED TONS OF OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE OF YOU AND I'M GLAD YOUR FUTURE IS MY PRESENT REALITY. MY CANCER IS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE PAIN OF REGRET. THIS IS WHAT HURTS THE MOST AND I OWE IT ALL TO YOU.YES YOU GODDAMMMM FUKKING MOTHERFUKKA, SHE LIKES YOU. ISNT THAT CLEAR ENOUGH YOU INCOMMENSURABLE HEAP OF ROAD APPLES?AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHHHH!I rest my case.P.S. Do it or I kill you.

    Just Play the Game 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


I was watching the movie, The Legend of Bager Vance and one phrase really struck me: quote: Golf is a game that cant be won but only played. It wasnt until last night that I fully became to understand the full import of that statement.  For the first time in my life, I went up to a woman and asked her for her home phone number with no fear. I acted without reflection at all.  She told me, she couldnt do that.  After I left with a smile on my face, I started to laugh, not because of her poor excuse, but because I didnt honestly care if I got the number or not.Like golf, you can never fully ever win with women.  Women will do whatever they want, when they want, with who ever they want.  Women can never be controlled, but what you can control is your emotions and response to her actions.Me getting turned down, was secondary to fact that I asked this woman out with no reflection: I just did it.  I responded appropriately with action to the situation and what I felt.  This very act alone defined me as a man of action that could never be changed by her response or not.  I took control of the situation by doing what I wanted do and what was true to me; I alone gave value to her.I could not control her response, but I could control my action leading up to it.  This was a powerful act, a successful act that overcame all my insecurities and left them behind.The key to success is responding appropriately with action without regards of success or failure.Dating, like golf, is just a game with funny rules and quirks.  Once you start playing it for sake of it and not trying to win it or somehow come on top (because you cant ever fully win it) then good things tend to happen.  Ultimately it is the very desire to somehow succeed that ultimately causes you to fail.  Bager Vance in the movie, says, There is only the hole, the ball and you.  When you begin to see that there is simply the woman, yourself and the movement of your mind and nothing else then the stark simplicity and beauty of situation unfolds before you.  When you act there is no fear because successs and failure are immaterial in comparison to the act itself.   You can not control the success of failure of the act, but you can control the act itself.  In other words, why worry or give value to something (a woman) you cant control but only influence?Its really that simple.  Just play the game.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Simple.[This message has been edited by DarkDream (edited 01-19-2002).]

    <h3>
    Self Confidence 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Here are some of my own thoughts on Self Confidence.How many things do we all do that are way more risky then approaching a woman, chatting her up, and getting her number??I came to this realization recently at work. I am a shop steward, meaning that I am always having to stand up to management on a daily basis. It is sorta high stress, and the personal risks are pretty high; I have to keep myself and others from getting in trouble at work, and I get criticized by co-workers and especially management; it is a leadership role with all the demands that implies. The other day I had to lay it on the line with the main manager. He totally backed down. I was feeling pretty good about that. I work with the public, and about 5 minutes later this woman came in, whom I have always been curious about and who is very attractive. Then I thought: it makes no sense that I can be on one hand be screwing with the people in charge at work, but shy away from something as simple as asking for a number, even from someone who is super-attractive. I was feeling so confident that I was able to skip over most of the small talk (we already have a kind of rapport) and just ask her if she wanted to go out. She said yes and then gave me her work number. Sh*t, that was so easy, and I wouldn't have cared if she had said no. Then I thought; how many people do things, like make major investments, compete in sports (esp martial arts), have dangerous jobs, all of which are risky, but can't ask a woman out? Putting in this perspective changed my whole attitude in seconds! And now I have a potentially hot first date as a reward (I'll find out in 4 or 5 days   )

    Confidence is the key to women, but control is the key to confidence 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Eveyone says, be more confident...confidence is the key.  True.  All of us at one point didn't have confidence when it came to women.  With all the pressures of friends and society, we put a women up on that dreaded pedestal, and made them something they are not...above us.To this day, yeah, I STILL get nervous when trying to pick up a girl.  But I am in CONTROL of my feelings, therefore, it doesn't show.One of the best quotes from the D.J. bible is to NOT put them on that pedastal, "girls eat, sleep, and crap, exactly the same as we do."I carry that with me wherever I go, and when I see a girl I like, I remember the DJ bible, specifically that quote, and the girl doesn't seem too out of reach anymore.  Of course you still have to have SOME confidence to appoach her.Confidence is the key, but how does one GET confidence, or at least APPEAR to have confidence?CONTROL.CONTROL will get you that confidence.Be in CONTROL of EVERYTHING you do.  Your life, your job...be in control when approaching a girl, and DON'T CARE SO MUCH.  It's not the end of the world when you don't get that number.I am successful in my job.  I am an actor, I own my own production company, and I have done EVERY job and hobby you could imagine.  But I would not say I am a pefect 10.  Hell who is?  People have percieved me in 4 ways throghout my life...everything from Ugly, Okay, Cute, Hot - yet I haven't got a facelift or plastic surgury.  So what was it?I started getting the HOT term, when I started to realize that women LOVE a guy in CONTROL.  I don't mean CONTROLLING her, but in CONTROL of himself.  And in turn, that comes accross as CONFIDENCE.  I was 18 and a manager of a clothing store a couple of years ago.  I had 4 girls working for me, and little did I know that EVERY one of them wanted me.  And to be honest with you, I wasn't very successful with girls.  So "why" did they want me.  I treated them like ordinary employees. I didn't put too much effort into "knowing" them.  I kept business, business.  Yet they wanted me.  Was it because of looks?No.It was becasue I was in CONTROL.To them I was their boss.  I knew MORE than they did.  I was the teacher.  I was in CONTROL.  My point of view when talking to these girls wasn't, "your so hot, I want you."  It was, you're hot, but you're my employee.  Case closed."Outside of work, I couldn't get a girlfriend.  I was shot down, I always seemed to be scared and nervous.  My attitude toward girls were different in the "outside world".  I had them on a pedestal.A year later I produced a play.  Again I was in CONTROL.  One of the girls in the play I knew from school.  I went for her a few months before, but she didn't like me.  As soon as the play went underway...she was all over me.  I didn't change, but my attitude towards HER did.  To me, she was now a co-worker...my employee.  Instead of being in this mindframe of "wanting" her.  I was in CONTROL.  She drove me home everyday, she was laughing at all my jokes...she even asked me if I wanted to fool around with her!  3 months before, she wouldn't give me the time of day.What was the difference?CONTROL.Girls love it.  And that CONTROL, assuming you are IN CONTROL, becomes confidence.  Or at least appears to be.Now, I have taken this CONTROL outside of my profession, to dating and girls specifically.I took them off that pedastel, and brought them beneath me.  I am the teacher.I'll talk to a girl like a guy...and I'll talk to all of them.  When you approach a girl, all you have to do is take CONTROL of the situation. Instead of working on CONFIDENCE, try working on CONTROL.  Find what it is in your life that you are NOT in CONTROL of, and fix it.  When you see that girl, realze that if you are NOT IN CONTROL, that perfect women could be gone forever.  Realize that you could die tomorrow.I asked a lot of women I know, and some girls who I just met on the street.  And I asked them..."why would you give a guy your number?"  90% of the responses were..."If he's cute and knows what he wants."THAT'S IT!So what have you got to lose?Take CONTROL, walk up to that girl know what you want and talk to her like a PERSON, not a GODDESS. You are the one on that pedestal.You are the one in CONTROL. [This message has been edited by Tantric (edited 02-24-2002).]

    succesful people 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


  I teach math at university where I am studying, and my students are always complaining about how the class is too hard or whatever. I give them a little speech that I will also share with you.  The people who are most succesful in life are not the people who complain how they got the short end of the stick or how things are too hard. The succesful people in life are those who accepted who they are and the way life is and decided that they are going to make the most out of what they have. There is always going to be someone smarter/ stronger/better than you so deal with it. In fact in what you want to do chances are you will have average natural ability.   So now that you know you are probably average what are you to do, you are to go and do the best you can. Focus on what it is you need to do, if you need to work twice as hard as your friend should you be jealous, if you want, but that will only waste time. When I took this class I easily spent 20 hours a week in it. Was I jealous of my friends that only spent 5, yes I was, but did I worry about it, no. I was just much happier come test time when I got an A and they didn't.   I was not always as good at math as I am now. I used to get c's and d's in math, it was only when I focused that I did well. That is what you need to do, focus. Always remember, the harder you work to acheive knowledge the harder it is to lose it. My classmates might have always caught on quicker, but it left there brain as quickly as it came to them, I remembered things better.   How can we adjust this philosophy to dj'ing, simple. Fact is some guys are just going to be better at getting girls than you are, that is just how it is. Girls are going to be attracted to them easier and you are going to sometimes feel down about yourself over it. Some guys are going to see improvement much faster than others, it might take five days, five months or five years. The fact of the matter is though, the harder you work to acheive success the harder it is going to be to forget the things that made you succesful.    I have had small successes, numbers, and dates in the last 10 month's since I started coming here. I will admit though I have not acheived the level that I want to yet though. I see complete chumps pull the girls I wanted. Do I get down about it, sometimes, but I never let it show or last any negligible period of time. When the time comes I know that I will be pulling most of the women I want and the relationships will be on my terms. That is what being a dj is really about, not accepting any relationship that is not acceptable to you.  ------------------The very first step to becoming what you want to be is to accept all responsibility for the situation you are in.  in short: quit whining!!!!!!!!!

    Keys to Don Juan 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Gentlemen,Welcome to Don Juan.There are THREE KEYS that unlock a series of locks that is Woman.Key One: Her sexuality and YOURS shall be embraced.You have acted thus far as nonsexual going so far to SUPPRESS your sexuality. Why does she choose the Jerk over the Nice Guy? It is not because she dislikes niceness. A woman would rather be with a male, no matter how tyrannical, over an androgynous, no matter how nice.You have not been dating but making friends. You do not need twenty-five female friends. You are so non-sexual that you do not initiate contact. You do not TRY to talk to a woman that leads them aroused. Heaven forbid that a woman might think that you want to bang her! Your passive and cautious talking with them, your posture, the way how you dont look at her since she might see the truth in your eyes- these are a few of the MANY WAYS you have been dodging not her sexuality BUT YOUR OWN.Damn it, YOU ARE MALE! SHE IS FEMALE! Sexuality is Gods precious gift! It is Natures course! Why are you afraid? WHY!?Key Two: Fun shall be the focus.Why are you so serious? You are not to propose to her on the first date, fourth date, or eighth date. You are not to talk about your life story.From sex to the very first meeting, the focus must be on fun. You must get this soul-mate, true-love, and pedestal worship out of your head. Not that these things are necessarily bad, they poison everything AT FIRST.Fun is a powerful key. It is so powerful that female friends may become interested in you just solely because YOU ARE FUN. On dates, focus not on what will go wrong, not on what will go right, not on the outcome but on the game. Even if the girl ends up being a loser, you still win because you were focusing on the fun and not on the girl. (And those that focus on the girl lose focus on the fun and, thus, lose the girl).Key Three: You are the PRIZE to be won.Think She wants to be with me, rather than I want to be with her. Imagine girls are gravitating towards you in every way. Assume that she is interested in you. If she is not, assume that she will be.This will keep you from being disrespected, keep you from falling for an UG, keep you from sacrificing your life to her, and keep the focus on her winning you. YOU are the GREAT CATCH!But it is not arrogance. This key unleashes a pleasant cockiness. Combine this with the Fun Key, and you have both cockiness and humor.These are the THREE OBSTACLES (the three locks) that most guys have trouble with. They defy the first key by acting like sexual androids. They defy the second key by being consumed with their feelings and, on dates, seeing HER as the fun rather than the date itself (and end up doing BORING dates like going to the movies, going to dinner, etc. where they should be doing ACTION dates like dancing, skating, bowling, rock climbing, etc.). They defy the third key by seeing the woman as the trophy, as the goal, and, by such, all their actions revolve around her as she is the focus and axis of their desires. Here we find gifts, poetry, chocolate, ten phone calls a day, and so on being thrown at the girl. He sees her as a goddess so she begins to think herself one. Then she DUMPS him and goes for the guy that treats her roughly (in hopes that HE will see her as a goddess).Women have a series of locks. These three keys of Don Juan can unlock most if not all.So dream no more, gentlemen. Dream no more! The night has passed. A dawn of new life is upon you. So wear not the past of dreadful woes. Let them go. And may you be full of joy and life.And prepare yourself for your dreams with women are about to come true.------------------PookAs you think, you shall become.The greatest risk you can take in life is not to risk at all.What you do today echos a lifetime.[This message has been edited by Pook (edited 03-24-2002).]

    A Word About Success  
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Have you ever taken Calculus? Even if you haven't, bear with me, I won't give you a math test or anything. I *have* taken calculus. But I didn't start out there. I first had to learn to count. Then, over time, I learned how to add. Then subtract. Soon, it was multiplication and division. Decimals. Fractions. Percentages. Story problems. Geometry. Simple equations. Binomial and trinomial equations. Trig functions. Get the picture yet? You can't just jump from the multiplication and division right into calculus. You start small and eventually end up big. When you have zero experience with girls, any interaction can be viewed as a success. Imagine that you're so shy that you just can't even think of talking to a girl. Get up your courage and just say "Hi" to a girl. That's a success. Just the simple act of saying hi. Smile, make eye contact. A girl smiles at you? Success. Get comfortable around women. Go up and approach women. Strike up a conversation. Success. Start getting numbers. Success. Get a date. Success. Go for the kiss. Success. I'm sure you're getting the point. Even the smallest things, like smiling and getting a smile back, are "beginner successes", because you are reaching outside of your normal limitations. You are growing and that is what being a success is all about. Even getting a rejection is a success, because you are now putting yourself on the line and going for it. Getting the rejection is unimportant compared to all of the things that led up to it. If she says, "I'm not interested" or "I have a boyfriend" or "I wouldn't date you in a million years, even if you were the last guy on earth" -- SUCCESS. You did it. You approached her. You found a girl who isn't interested in you, and you're just that much closer to finding one who is. Approaching another girl, after a rejection, is a HUGE success. It proves you can get back in the saddle and you won't let anything hold you down.

    Nice guys get dumped?  Read this!

 Here is a recent newsletter I received regarding "nice guy syndrome".  It is entitled "great sexpectations" and can be subscribed to at www.shagmail.com Today's Topic: Nice Guy CursePerhaps you remember the letter I printed in reader commentsa few weeks ago? Some poor tortured soul wrote in about thefact that the woman he treated like gold, broke up with himto take up with someone he considered several links down onthe food chain. After scrutinizing his relationship he sar-castically declared to attract his next mate by losing hisjob, using foul language, and practicing less than a soundhygiene regiment. I wouldn't want to discourage anyone fromtrying to improve their romantic endeavors, but I think there'sa better way to handle this situation.What's really happening here has nothing to do with being toonice. Women have no problems with nice; they have a problemwith ambivalence, passivity, androgynous behavior, and awishy-washy demeanor. Women are attracted to confidence andstrength, but when there's no conflict..."yes dear, no dear"it leads to boredom and hostility.You know you've entered the first stages of "nice guydom"when you notice your gal becoming slightly more acidic withyou. Her attitude will cool and you'll notice that she nolonger asks you for your opinion because you've lost yourself.Rule number one is never lose yourself to a woman. You can'twrap your whole world around her without sacrificing your in-dividuality. Most women adore a man who has a sense of him-self, and knows who he is. It goes beyond just knowing whoyou are; it entails asserting yourself and honoring yourideals. Don't change them to agree with her. If you do she'llsee how much of a doormat you can be. I'm not saying thatwomen take a cruel interest in pushing someone a little toohard. It has more to do with pushing for a reaction. ANY re-action would be welcome except another "okay, whatever yousay." Disintegrating into a spineless wonder only creates morehostility. Pretty soon she'll be pushing the envelope just tosee if there's anyone home! It sounds childish, but its not.If you can't fight for yourself she's going to think you can'tfight for her either. It lies deep in the DNA to want to feelprotected. Notice the word protected as opposed to bullied. Awoman doesn't want to be told what to do, she wants to berespected. Sometimes the nice guy syndrome leads to lack ofself-respect. No woman respects a man who doesn't respecthimself first. I'm certain it works the other way around aswell.What's the solution? It's more like a few strategies to keepfrom falling into this pattern. It works best if you chall-enge your woman from time to time by NOT giving in. Yes, it'spolite to ask what she would prefer, but assert your own pre-ferences rather than always caving into her will. It's notrude, it's just part of keeping the relationship honest. I'mcertain that there were a few guys out there that didn't wantto see Titanic right? That's all I'm saying. There should beequal give and take over decisions no matter if it's dinnerchoices, or who gets on top!Passivity is the number one killer of relationships. Not onlyshould you act on what you say; you need to act in ways thatentail more than just the remote. Sometimes it's the sedentarythat suffer more break-ups. Surprise her with your capacity tobe spontaneous, and part of that means not asking her permiss-ion to be spontaneous! That would just put you back to squareone in the jellyfish game.Just to recap; its not the nice guys that are being dumped.It's the killer trio of passivity, boredom, and lack of self-confidence that will effectively end all romance. Passionthrives on pushing buttons. If you remove your buttons, she'llhave nothing to push! I can't wait to get this batch of mail,so let me know if you agree or not. Also, clue me in on yourexperiences with this syndrome so we can have fun in a fewFridays during reader comments. I'm not asking your permissionto end this; I'm just leaving you! (Deal with it baby!)

    <h3>
    "Jerks vs. Nice Guys" Part infinity.... 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


This discussion will forever go around in circles - the main forum is already laddened with this debate.  So here something to think about.....Have you ever stop and think to wonder why most women seem to go after all the wrong guys for all the wrongs reasons? To completely end the mystery that perhaps many of you men in the group may have been wondering about for a while, most women absolutely DO go after jerks. But to say "jerk" is not a truly accurate description of the type of men these women go after. Women go after men who are incredibly self-confident with women? -- No, not entirely.  They go after the man who is not afraid of their p@ssy? (please forgive the blunt language) -- Not really, either. Well I think the truth is this: Women, more times than not, don't even know THEMSELVES what it is they are after. Very seldom do the ever stop to sit down and think of what kind of guy they would really like to have in their life. Their idea is ambiguous at best.So it really comes down to this. Women just plainly and purely end up going after the guy who can make them feel the best. Period. The WAYS in which they are made to feel good by the guy(s) they ultimately select are irrelevant.  That's where, and why, they get into trouble. In an instant gratification society, they just go after what turns them on the most, first. This is where the so-called "nice-guy" loses out (which is not an accurate description also). The so-called nice guy is generally not a smooth-talker. He does not come-on like he has loads and loads of great feelings and highs to spare, and generally not extrememly outspoken.From women's viewpoint, this is taken in all sorts of erroneous ways that it probably shouldn't be taken. But that's life, and the legacy of the poor "nice-guy." In passing, it should be noted for the record, that not ALL women go after the so-called "jerk" types. Do you want to know which women do? Only the women you want. So in that light, you may as well say "all" of them, right?When women continue to jack-over the guys they really should perhaps AT LEAST consider giving more of a chance to, these guys eventually, and usually quite quickly, begin to realize what kind of men the women they would like to have are going after. The result is that one day something just snaps inside of them, and they begin to emulate and become like the "jerks" that "most" women seem to love so much. In order to become that kind of man effectively, it usually has to be taken all the way to the end, for the "jerk" mindset would not be truly established if it were not. What that amounts to is becoming the "jerk" that smooth talks women and turns them on in many ways by showing that they have loads and loads of great feelings and highs to spare all for the woman. And in the end, after they have been promptly jacked, the guy dumps them. Why? Because that is the jerk's, and the women who go after jerks, legacy.  So when women inadvertently, or purposely, create so-called "jerks" out of so-called "nice guys", they are just inadvertently f@cking over other women, their own kind.[This message has been edited by Adonis (edited 08-23-2000).]

    <h3>
    Confessions of a Self
    </h3>
    <p>
    


As I've been reading about the problems and posts that soon-to-be-DJs have posted here, I've done a lot of searching in hopes that I could write a post or tip that would help out those in need. After a lot of thinking, I realized that the best thing that I could do to help out myself and others is to tell my story. If even one person out there can relate to my story, then I'll be satisfied. So here goes.I was always a follower when it came to hanging out with my friends in high school. If I suggested something to do, it was rarely heeded as a good idea. When it came to women, I would get petrified. I don't know where it started, but I would be to nervous to start a conversation. I was never as strong or as athletic as my friends in the big sports (i.e. soccer, football, baseball). And all of my friends did sports. As you can probably guess, this was not good for my self-esteem. When I would get up the courage to ask a girl to dinner, I was usually told that I was a nice guy and that they just wanted to be friends. When I look back on some of the things I did, man, I really let women take advantage of me in the worst ways. I was the stereotypical "doormat". I had no faith in my abilities to attract women at all.Enter college. I was definitely intimidated when I first got into college and I knew that I had to start doing something for my self-esteem or I would eek my way through life being too afraid of women to end up with anybody. So I took up weightlifting. Now I'm not a small guy: I stand 5'11 at a solid 180 pounds. And I'm not a bad looking guy. But I still would find things wrong with myself which I attributed to my lack of success with women. "My nose is too big. I'm too fat. I think I'm going bald." Anybody who has been in this situation can tell you it sucks bad. Now I'm not saying I didn't get any women. I had a few here and there, but not as many as I should have had nor the quality I wanted. The hardest person to please was myself. Needless to say, weightlifting helped a little bit. But I still wasn't happy. I was still deathly afraid to approach a gorgous lady sitting all by herself. I can't tell you how many times I kicked myself in the a$$ for letting those opportunities pass me by (and believe me it happened a lot!). So I turned to playing basketball with friends. Again, slight improvement, but far from what I wanted. And women still used me. I could never say no to a woman. If they asked me to jump, I jumped. If they were bored I was right there to take them out and right back to the jerk they went. I couldn't figure out how these a******* got all the women while a nice guy like me got screwed.What the hell was wrong with me?! I think I finally answered that question with this one chick in my class. She was easily a 9 in my eyes and I got the courage up to talk to her. We made plans to meet at this deli for lunch. I sat there for 30 minutes before I finally called her from the place and she told me that she had forgotten! $^!%&@^*!@%*&!@^*&*!!!! I ripped into her and slammed the phone down. I could not comprehend what my problem was. I immediately walked up to the first attractive girl and asked her for her # and I got it. I turned around 5 minutes later and got another #. I did this for an hour in the mall I was at and I got 11 out of 13 phone numbers. I had had a revelation. Why was I making myself unhappy over these self-centered b*tches?! I was basing my life around trying to find a girl. Simple as that. I wasn't enjoying my life because I was so intent on a woman to make me happy that I never did things that I loved (hobbies, passions).And here's the kicker. When I went to class the next day, she came right up to me and apologized and wanted to make it up to me. I told her I'd think about it and flipped her my number. She called me the next day and wanted to come over to watch a movie. She definitely made it up to me that night  So the moral of the story is this: Don't ever, and I mean EVER let a woman walk on you. When you first meet a chick, you have to command respect from her with your ATTITUDE. The way you walk, the way you act, and the way you talk all tell a woman whether or not you are a needy person or an independent MAN. Let her know you don't need her. She is 1 out of approximately 3 billion women on this planet. If she says no, is it the end of the world? Oh Hell No! there are another 2,999,999,999 women out there who are dying to meet you. So stop feeling sorry for yourself and get out there and meet them. If she tries to play mind games with you (which they have mastered) give her the boot. No woman is worth waiting for.Now for some helpful hints. You knew they were coming.1) When you make eye contact with a beautiful woman in passing, smile and go about your business. Unless she holds eye contact for longer than necessary, in which case you should have already introduced yourself. Never look down after making eye contact; this is a sign of submission.2) Don't ever say "Idon't know, what do you want to do". This is murder!! If you ever use that line or anything similair, you have already blown your chances. What you are really saying is "Yes, I will be your puppy dog. Ask for anything and it is yours." Make a decision for crying out loud. You know whether you want to do something or not. Don't be afraid to say it.3) If she says or does something to try to take advantage of you, make it known right away. If you let her get away with it, she will know she can keep doing it. And then you, my friend, have shown her that you are not to be respected. Women want a MAN who they can respect.4) I know it has been said countless times, but kino is a necessity. If you think you don't know how to do kino, then it is fear that is holding you back. Lightly touch her on the arm. My personal favorite is to come up behind a woman to tell her something, put my hand on her shoulder and state whatever it is in her ear in a low voice. Then when you are done, walk away and lightly run your fingers across her upper back. Don't turn around when you walk off. Keep in mind to use kino sparingly and for god's sake, don't molest her.5) If you are feeling down about your abilities, take a vacation with 2 or 3 close friends to a "hot spot". I prefer a beach with plenty of nightclubs. Then just enjoy yourself. If you see a girl who you "think" you have no chance with, go start a conversation. Are you ever going to see her again if she says no? Of course not. You'll never have to worry about feeling awkward around her. It's water under the bridge. You have lost absolutely nothing. And you have gained experience. You can look back and figure out what part of your game needs to be fine tuned.In the end, it all comes down to a state of mind. You have to know, not think, KNOW that you don't need a woman to be happy. This is not an overnight change. I'm still working on that aspect to this very day. You have to enjoy life for what it is and stop worrying. Everything will work itself out. Trust me. If you read my story, you know that anybody can do this. You just have to believe in yourself. Believe in yourself and believe in life. If you let fear creep into your mind when approaching a woman, then you have already lost. After all, "We (men) have nothing to fear but fear itself".

    <h3>
    The "Nice Jerk" Primer 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Guys who are strictly nice, for the most part, finish last. I used to be one - I speak from experience. That is, until that day when I had enough and decided that something had to give - either I'd keep getting treated like crap and make a life out of it, or start from within and change my whole attitude. Well, if you've been reading my posts for any length of time, it should be pretty obvious what direction I chose. I now see myself as a nice jerk - not one extreme or the other but somewhere in the middle. And hopefully the following pointers will help you get to that point if you desire to change your life around like I did and get some more play. For starters, demonstrate to her that you have an opinion. Nothing is more annoying than going out with someone who has no mind of their own. Don't straddle the fence about anything, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem..Italian or Chinese....going out vs. staying in...Pepsi vs Coke. ANYTHING! This demonstrates decisiveness...you have a clear sense of what satisfies and are not going to tolerate anything less than that. In ANY aspect f your life. In a relationship, this comes into play all the time - you're set on going someplace and she decides then that she doesn't, etc. DOn't play into that! I got into an argument with the girl I was seeing at the time on New Year's Eve and we were to spend the night at a nice downtown hotel. She was carrying on like a baby that afternoon and started saying that she was so annoyed with things that she didn't even know if she wanted to get together. What did I do? I told her that that's her decision but that I am not going to put up with that b.s. And then I hung up on her. She called back in a few minutes, apologized and quit her whining.Secondly, have more than one option. This is something I always stress but only because it is so true. When you get hung up on a honey sometimes, you start wondering about every little thing she does - did she go out tonight? With who? WHy didn't she call? ETC! I have always put myself in a position where, quite franky, I am way too busy to even worry about what she (or any) of the women in my life are doing! It's actually a nice break when I DON'T hear from them! More than one option makes you relaxed and allows you "give" - you can afford to make a mistake because you have a "spare".Also, be sure to tease her. The "nice guy" is way too damn polite and is afriad of offending. Now I do not offend, but I do have fun with the women I date because I give them a hard time about stupid things - I tease them about their drinking habits, their jobs, anything! It totally lightens the mood and I welcome their insults back - it creates a whole "playful" atmosphere - which always lends itself well to practicing keno. I honestly don't waste my time with women who can't joke back. And I have this concept so down that women are constantly telling me about how funny I am.Lastly, don't always make yourself available. If you have more than one option, this will be easy. Like I said, it's hard for me sometimes to find the time, and that is a beautiful thing to be in such demand! But don't call her everyday, don't e-mail every day, don't get her tired of hearing from you. And let's face it - does anything new and exciting happen to YOU every day? Probably not. It's like newspaper delivery - you get used to it showing up that it gets to the point where you may not even read it. But miss a day and you get as mad as hell, right? Let her miss you. Don't let her think, even if you do, that she is the center of your life.Well, that's all from me for now. I think these are the basics that you need to know in order to turn yourself into being a nice jerk like me. I always treat women with respect, but I also look out for number one - Big Don. And bro, that's whose most important in all of this, because if you can't look in the mirror and be happy with who you see looking back, then that's when you got problem. MAKE IT HAPPEN!TCB

    <h3>
    My Sh*t Theory 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


O.K.  I hear the boards are gettign thin lately for material.  I want to add this excerpt from a rant I sent to another "Why are women so screwed up" page a while back.   It will probably get more exposure and comment here than it did on the page I originally submitted it to, since this page was mostly whiners wondering why chicks don't like nice guys instead of this forum which is mostly about understanding how to get past that idea.  I call it my "Sh*t Theory", it is original, entertaining, and hints at the truth.   Women say with the mouth "I like you, you're (insert complement here) but....."  Out of the mouth comes these "I want a good man with brains, heart, likes children, etc." comments.  You hear them and get mixed messages.  The next time you hear this, and you will hear it again, and again, and again, take that girl, if she's not prohibitively overweight, and flip here over.  Grab her right on the spot and flip her over, so you can be head-level with her a$$.  What women really want comes out of  their a$$!  Follow me?  Women want "S**T"!  S**tty men, to be treated like s**t, to eat s**t day-in, day out.     This, I call the "S**t Theory".  As much hypothesis testing has gone into this study as any scientific experiment in history.  Actually more.  Follow me on this one.     Think about this: Most women, as little girls, 'hated' the boys.  They thought boys were 'gross', they teased, and being roughly physically equal at that age, even beat up the boys.  Then their sex organs began pumping and they decided they 'liked' the boys.  But the truth of the matter is that for most women a little bit of that instinctive dislike exists still in adulthood.  Also, just like they secretly 'liked' the teasing and attention of a boy telling them "I hate you Peggy Sue" and pulling their pigtails, they still like that a$$hole today.  This doesn't mean there is justification in hurting women, it is just a proven theory.     Let us not forget too that most women like drama in their lives.  "I'm only happy when it rains" wasn't written by the group Garbage, it was collectively written by the millions of drama queens out their and Garbage just made a buck off of the phrase.  From Maine to Arizona, in the ghetto, behind ivy-covered walls, women long for and seek out drama in their lives.  They want to be in the 'news' all the time, so they overamplify, even provoke and create mostly negative situations so they can be in the news as well as being the 'poor victim' of misfortune.  There are thousands of common examples of what I am talking about in well-known culture, so I'm not going to list them here, but just think about it and you'll agree.  Women, having some consciousness, cannot bring themselves to 'victimize'  'GOOD' men by trapping us with unexpected pregnancies, provoking us into beating them (cause' they know a GOOD man wouldn't) or creating havoc in our lives to spice it up.  Just like a soap opera, it would not be interesting if all the stuff was good, some outrageous and unbelievable stuff must occur to keep the interest going.    This says nothing about physical abuse.  It has been my experience that women, loving scorn, like those guys who treat them bad, or treat them good on small occasions, like a night out, but talk to them badly the rest of the time.  They like those cowboys who spend their check on stuff for the truck but nothing for them.  Even though women will say "You never bring me flowers", they don't want flowers.  Or candy.  Valentine's Day is the biggest crock of s**t in the world.  Short of spending a couple of G's on a Val. Day ring, your best lay wouldn't come from a gift or card on the Red Day.  Next Val. Day, don't get your lover jack s**t!  I'm serious!  You want your brains sucked out through your stick, dog your women on Valentines Day.  After the drama YOU induced by 'hurting her feelings' has subsided, the make-up sex will be sensational, much better than the small 'thank you' f**k for spending $100 on roses and candy.  Take that $100 and buy yourself something nice.  She'll hate you for that too (if you aren't slick enough to hide it from her).  And then she'll probably let you lay the pipe harder than ever during the make-up sex session after THAT argument.  2 lays and a new saw or d.v.d. player later, you have become one of those "a$$holes" they love!!  THIS IS TESTED, RETESTED, AND PROVEN FACT!!!!  They want you to dog them so it will be like the schoolyard.  Those same girls who said "Billy is a poopy-head and smells" back in 1st grade secretly wanted to f**k Billy, but were years too early to understand what drove their scorn.  It was only after their breasts started popping out that they realized, instinctively, that they must appear to appeal to men to attract them so they can release that feeling--the same feeling that made them hate and yet love the boys at the same time.  This is the conflict between women's f**ked-up intellects, which tell them the man who screws them loves them, and instinct, which tells them to screw the man they love.     It sound simple, but it is true.  Women like 'a$$'.  They like everything that has to do with the 'a$$'--a$$holes and being treated like S**T.  Hell, most, no almost ALL even like a hard spanking while you are ****in' em'.  Believe me, if I was a Nobel-Prize winner in peace, with flowers in my hair, strumming a guitar, singing love songs with little children gathering at my feet and money falling out of my pocket, women will be attracted.  Attracted to come look at the spectacle.  Proud to know me--as a friend.  Trying to slip that money out of my pocket slyly.  I get so many complements from my female 'friends'.  Do I score pu$$y from those females?  HELL NO!!!  What allegedly warms a women's heart (kindness, love, sense of humor) is what all us GOOD GUYS provide for women's ENTERTAINMENT, knowingly or not.  They pay attention to you for the humor, like the talking or advice, for the entertainment, but they get their sex elsewhere.  I watch MTV for the entertainment, but I get my sports coverage from another channel, yet I can say I really LIKE MTV.  If you are ever unfortunate enough to hook up with a chick like this (about 95% of them) and get in a relationship, you will soon find that your woman will go to the comedy club (you) for the laughs, then stop at the strip club (some other 'stud') for the sex.  Then she will wipe her chin and walk back in your door as Ms. Proper, probably provoke (or invoke) argument because she feels guilty or wants that damn 'drama' again, and will  leave in tears swearing you are the a$$hole.  No, you are not an a$$hole.  If you were an a$$hole, you would be in an a$$hole---hers!    So, in closing, just remember that: 1.  Women talk out of their a$$es, and that's why you are mystified at their motives and words, and: 2.  Nice guys are boring and NICE, that's why women cannot scorn them as easily, thus, my gentlemanly friend, gentlemen get no play!!!

    Prick for a day

Having trouble sheding the nice guy way of thinking?Be a prick one day this week. One of the biggest things a nice guy (read a guy not getting any play) has to get over is this fear of losing people's approval.I'm not saying you go and curse girls out or do anything that will get you arrested, but just be a little pushy and arrogant. You'll be amazed at the response you get. If a girl gets all offended at your behavior just tell her to go to hell and walk away. This is best done someplace where you really dont give a damn if you get a bad rep there or get told to get out. A good place is a smallish restaraunt since there are prolly hundreds just like it in your city. Here are the rules of thumb that I go by when I do this:1) never say please or thank you.2) never say hello or goodbye.3) approach women that you are not even interested in and have no intention of calling back even if you get their number.4) if you are turned down or insulted don't let it go without sending back a zinger or two.5) HAVE FUN with it. when you get back to your car after hitting a place you ought to be just about laughing your ass off. they probobly will be too. Probobly it will be the most interesting thing that happened that whole week for whoever you do this to.by the end of the day (or a couple of hours or whatever) you will have been rejected rudely by women a few times. If you follow my rules any woman that ignores or rejects you will get an earful back. After you see that your life has not crumbled down around you, its the same type of feeling like when you stood up to that schoolyard bully and howed him you weren't gonna take his sh** any more. You will look at women in a whole different way.don't beleive me? Try it. Just remember, you arn't trying to get into a fight. If she rejects or ignores say something rude and leave. If she is back there still yelling **** after you just ignore her. Ever since I tried this one day I have almost no fear of rejection when I approach in a 'normal' non-jerk manner. I know that if she rejects she better be nice about it and use good manners cause if not I'ma put a verbal hurtin on her and walk the hell away laughing my ass off.Here is an example. (really pretty, but snotty-looking teenage girl sweeping the floor in a Mc Donalds)Me: (really rude and sarcastic) You missed a spot.Her: (Evil look then keeps sweeping)Me: don't look at me like that. It's not my fault you can't sweep a floor right.Her: **** off!Me: (getting up and starting to walk out) How original, mind if I use it later? No wonder this place is so dirty with you working here.Her: (standing there holding her broom looking like if I just spit on the Mona Lisa)Me: LMAO in my car.

This is ONLY FOR people (not only for women often referred to as b!tches) who want extraordinary treatment. You want to become a jerk, not an ******* . (It takes one to know one.)Dont get too emotional with a female. Falling in love is stupid because it is putting your own life in someone elses hands. The life that you mom and dad have worked years to build and then you yourself have build primarily. You cannot put all that in someone elses hands. There is no excuse for that. Be open and precise to women. This is a show of confidence and its a way of saying that you dont take bull****. Your emotions, your past, your weaknesses, your feelings (the emotional perception of events,) your fears should stay hidden. That way nobody will know what to expect from you which will eventually lead to people underestimating you and getting crushed or beaten up. Want to get stimulated to get laid often? First start with writing down every woman you have had sex with and count them. Keep score and try to obsessively increase the score. Of those women youve ****ed write down the things that made them lose control plus the things that made them think you were cool. Dont worry you will very likely not forget the times you have actually made love. Dont write those down. Those are only for you only. For your emotional side that only you know about.Always keep your intentions hidden till youve achieved your goal. Or else she may not like your idea. When you get caught; lie, act like nothing has happened but if it doesnt help just use all you know about her against her and if everything goes wrong walk away without ever saying a thing. Dont fall in love. When she is talking to a guy and you want to talk to her and the guy has a comment do not let him walk over you. Say something like Take a walk or Go ride a bike or Get some fresh air man or just **** off. He doesnt want to go? Grab him by the neck and make pull him up and push him an arm-length away to let him know that he has to go now. Do not let people treat you with disrespect even if it this behaviour suddenly miraculously turns into a joke (because they see that youve gotten pissed.) Always stay serious in these cases till the end. Make them look away first. When they dont like your attitude and still want to stay rude just increase the intensity of your anger (you dont actually have to be angry for this. Just be a good actor.) Dont touch until the other has touched you. (in a fight) Make clear that you do not like to be touched by people who you dont want you to touch. If he doesnt let go and you know that he isnt probably going to strike you then step on his foot. In these situations always stay cool. Like nothing can harm you. In fact nothing can. You can be beaten up but remember what Tyler Durden did with the mafia guy in Fight Club? Pyschology. His body was pretty beaten up but its about the mind. When things really go wrong, imagine that you are the strongest man in the world. Never ever try think about how fast, slow, strong, weak, smart or smart your opponent is. For you its only about you. When things go even more wrong act like a pyscho. Laugh but never show that it hurts. People, even the craziest (and even police officers) are afraid of maniacs. You be one (good acting again) and you can make them polish your boots. Never become civilised. Even wearing a suit be yourself, direct and aggressive. It doesnt matter where you are wether it is Buckingham Palace or a striptease-joint. Stupid mother****ers are everywhere to be found. Thats why you are allowed to **** them everywhere. Just dont fight everywhere. Being aggressive doesnt mean being stupid. You can be highly classed, very intelligent, patient, slow and still be aggressive. Agressiveness exists in many forms that you have to explore for yourself. Even Bill Gates is aggressive or else he would have never come up with an outdated operating system that commercially succesful. People try to be tough. I guess its the nineties crap they have read from magazines in which was told that being bad to people is cool. They have to think again because they are bad, tough and mean but you (yourself) are the worst mother****er in the whole world. Nothing can or will ever break you. Not even when you are low on confidence for a period of time. Never stay silent and always crush the fvck out of them. Even when you dont feel like doing that. Talk openly about sex with a girl and laugh about it. Whatever you want to talk about as long it is not a boring conversation. Bring some humor in it. Be alone every once in a while and evaluate what youve accomplished and look at your weaknesses (you will not have much of them) and erase them from existence but never erase them from your memory. Never worry about anything. Because when you stress you body makes cortison and that molecule screws your recollection-abilities. You get a black-out. So do not stress. Start working out and keep on doing it your whole ****ing life. Busy period? Do something about it and start working out again regularly. Keep your brain active so that you stay alert and smart all the time. No mother****er can ever harm you then. You will think of everything and say I guessed she would have done that and be prepared. Looking at options isnt paranoia. If the CIA would have known about 11 september 2001 and told the people about what was going to happen to the city of New York and Washington D.C. many people would have thought the agency was being paranoid. But even impossible things happen. Beware of manipulative women. Because their actions are taken more personaly. Just fvck their mind and attitude. Better yet screw her literally and ditch the b!tch. Seduce her. Never ever loosen up. There is always an unstoppable number of jerks out there waiting to crush you the moment you dont pay attention. It doesnt have to be personal. If you get approached by an angry person (whos just interested in crushing his/her problems on your head) crush him/her no matter what. But dont say something wrong to people who have recently lost someone. They dont know any better. Youll beat them up if they keep giving you that bull**** behaviour. If you get depressed integrate that pissed off behaviour in your personality. It will make you avoid doing things you may one day regret. Stay friendly at first until that moment you get the idea people are being rude to you. Do not forgive till theyve apologized. Screw them. Learn about everything (practical as well as theoretical) you can. Knowledge is power and can be used to screw with people's minds. Most Don Juan skills are pure forms of manipulations. Go out there in the field and test everything (even the most stupid things.) You can test them at places where people don't know you; this will make things easier for starters. Having a conscience is only good in life and death matters and is the most fundamental handicap a Don Juan can have. So learn to shut it off. Go for all the money, health and power you can get. Don't be criminal. That's just stupid. Lie, lie and lie again and again whenever you need it. Don't get influenced by some peoples moral values. Fvck his/her values. Evil gives more efficient and more focussed power to a person. Love is for people who are idealists. They usually lose the first time and thats enough.Don't assume, know for sure. Treat only those people nice who deserve it. There are very few on this planet. Use your common sense and don't believe that there is a magical solution like a formula that will solve all your problems. Believing in God is only good for inner peace (evil can be in peace too. ) God or the universe as I call it won't help you if you sit on your ass and wait for the solutions to come. Don Juanism and everything else in life must be learned through very hard work. That's the magical formula to every problem you have. Depressed or in love? You are in control of your mind. Your mind isn't in control over you. Your mind is weaker than your spiritual essence and you can beat every psychological problem. Just be stubborn. There is nothing wrong with romance. It is just a method of your thoughts to create a different reality than the one which you are in. Stay angry. Do not tolerate people who are wrong to you. You are the most important person in your existence. Save yourself first. Only then you can save others. Make a lot of friends but stay evil.We humans are complex creatures. We cant always be nice. There are people who cross our borders and project their stupid behaviour onto us to make us become unhappy and lose control over ourselves. Those people need to be stopped because most people can only kill if they become the monster themselves.Suppl #1: How to be a Jerk! by stockholder.1. You get the idea that you're being watched? Look around you. You'll see that nobody is watching you. If anyone does you look him/her straight in the eye. I'll bet they'll look away. If they still watch you go and ask if you can help them with anything. They'll definitely stop watching you now. If someone is watching you can start doing crazy things. Like making licking movements toward him/her. This'll scare them off (or get you beaten up, but hey you are a jerk so you dont give a **** about it.)2. Being real; You have to check if the door is closed like for fifty times after you leave the house? Be real man! Checking twice enough. Think scientifically. Or statistically or something but please stop checking the door, the oven, your hair, the cardoor, your girlfriend who's talking to someone you don't know. Don't check too many times. Got problems with that? Then pray (as in faith) that nothing goes wrong but leave it alone. (krd said it was called obsessive compulsive disorder.) 3. Do you fear that you'll die alone? So stop sitting around and make as many friends as you can. Stop doing things alone. Invite someone. Off course we all need to be alone now and then but don't push the limits of being alone.4. Still don't believe that you are not being watched? How important do you think you are? Not that much. If there is a city square where a lot people sit. You go and walk through it. Stop in the middle of the square and look around for a while. If there are people watching; you read line 1 of this article. 5. Someone is practically begging you to do something you don't want to? Say "No" If she/he is a real friend he/she will forgive you for it. If she/he will not forgive you;let him/her walk to hell. Don't do anything you do not want to do.6. Tricks; dont fall for them. Plus things that change peoples behaviour;6a. People use compliments which are out of context. Like someone saying you have a beautiful name when she/he needs something done. Dont get soft! 6b. Wearing different clothes makes you do different things, this is like how prostitutes can do their jobs. Or nude models who are shy at first.6c. Other names make you do other things than usual. Like when someone calls you "Tiger" or "Kermit". Which one will make you do something confident? 6d. Different places make you act different. Why the hell would you spend twice the amount of money on something on a cruiseship that you wouldn't have bought were you in your normal surroundings?6e. Scents. The smell of chocolate makes you work harder. The smell of your own sweat (or your girls) makes you want to fvck. 6f. Music. The soundtrack of "Speed" will make you feel and act like a hero. The soundtrack of "Star Wars" will make the universe feel bigger than it seems. Rave music will make you feel rotten and a-social. 6g. Money.$19.99 looks and sounds cheaper than $20. 6h. Women will touch you and say sweet things to get something done. Say "No" till they offer sex. 6i. Alcohol: it will make you say and do crazy things like promising something stupid. Practice with a lot of drinks if you want to learn to control yourself to some extend while youre drunk. Dont get Korsakov while doing this. Never drink moonshine unless you want to become a blind and impotent jerk.6j. People will believe anything that looks and sounds professional. It doesnt have to be logical to be credible.6k. Cold water makes women want to pee. I hope you can use this to your benefit some day. 6l. All tricks can be adjusted to your needs. So go ahead and help yourself.7. Can't resist touching a nice ass? Do it. Most women won't even slap you because they feel like being watched themselvesand slapping would be embarassing wouldn't it. If they slap anyway well I won't take the responsibility because you can take care of yourself don't you? Look out for angry boyfriends.8. Don't ever tell a girl that you want to be friends with her. She'll never believe it or if she will then someone else will tell her that men are pigs and only think about sex. So you want to be her friend? Then use all the seduction techniques perfectly. It'll be great practice. You can always decide when or if she'll be a friend.9. When you've just cheated on your girlfriend and you still have women's perfume on you go to a store where you can buy women's perfume and try some stuff on yourself (you know as a gift.) Too much on the wrists and accidentally on your clothes and nobody will notice what you have around your neck. 10 Two forms of sexual manipulation;10a. Wear tight jeans (pants.) Ive noticed that when I work (Im a waiter in a youth-caf) with tight jeans on I get touched more on the butt than when Im in wide pants.10b. When your skin is red because of a too hot shower just leave it that way and don't be ashamed because red skin also stands sexual arousal. Washing with cold water after bath or shower makes your skin, lips and face red. 11. Threaten people if they don't do what you want. Not like:"I'm gonna kill you" but the eyecontact (no flinching, straight look) kind of way. Not talking helps too. Paradoxical??? Does Boba Fett say too much? Or Michael Myers? Not like Freddy Krueger. Doesn't matter how scary he looks he turns into a comedian the moment he talks too much. 12. Women are insecure about many things (look at your mothers.) These things can be used to manipulate them.13. When women talk too much put on your headphones and listen to music. That'll teach her.14. Lying;14a. If people ask you a question you don't want to answer ask something back without answering. Like; Jane:"Do you cheat on me?"You:"What do you think of as cheating?" or You:"Would I do that to you?"These counter-questions have delayed the requested answer just for a little while. I hope you can get yourself out of this. Takes a little practice 14b. Bend the truth. Like;Her:"Were you drunk yesterday? My fiends told me you acted like a jerk"You:"Me, no I wasn't drunk yesterday (youre thinking; not before 12 am)"You are not lying but you're just bending the truth. 15. When you're almost asleep start saying things like "I am confident! I am the man! I am attractive!" Repeat it when you wake up. 16. Remember the only one watching you is your conscience. You can shut it off. Or adjust it. 17. Don't ever remember a girl's birthday before you really know her. I did once. I was just talking with a girl when I told her her birthday. I'm a talent with remembering numbers so I told her the exact date and man she thought that was so scary. I explained her I have this thing with numbers (I summed up PI in 9 decimals and lightspeed in vacuum in 3 decimals. I was thinkin' about summing up the electron charge and that sort of stuff) but it didn't help although she said it was okay. I learned something very valuable. If you don't know a girl close enough don't remember her birthday. How can you score anyway???? Just remember the (little) things she has told you and let her now you've listened the previous times. I didn't argue because I had consumed a considerable amount of alcohol.One mistake I've made as well is that I always buy a drink for (ex-)colleagues no matter who. One girl I asked didn't want to drink. She must have thought I was trying to seduce her. Now I won't even offer her drinkingwater in a desert. Not any girl. Too bad. They have money too. Let them buy it first. 18. In case psychological warfare doesn't work; If a girl hits you first when you argue just hit her back. Warn her first. Say "If you hit me I'll hit you back" and really hit her if she hits you first. No one has the right to hit you unless you give them permission like in a boxing match or something. How do you deal with a (big) guy? A universal rule: dont underestimate your opponent. Better yet dont think about him at all. If he has already hit you; you just strike back. If you havent been hit yet; in the same way as with the girl but much more intense; warn him and do what you've told you would do. Dont ever bluff. Just hit him and run away or something but don't give him the opportunity to crush you. Kick his balls. His throat is sensitive but be careful with the throat. You don't want to take his life away. The place where the ribs end is sensitive and can be punched with a nice fist to take his breath away. Crush his foot. Twist his arm and hand. A strong blow in the stomach is the safest way though. Don't wait until he gains strength, keep controlling him and delay his actions by hitting him. I don't want you to fight but it helps your confidence if you know (just knowing helps too) how to deal with big guys. I've never had a fight but lessons in aikido and aiki-jitsu helped me to get in touch with my own vulnerability. I can fight now but I'd rather talk like a lawyer and beat my opponent with that. Why hit girls ??? Why should girls hit you ??? It will start with hitting you and end with a scissor between your legs. Show that you do not (in no way) tolerate people hitting you. You give them a finger and they will take your hand.19. Be a jerk but don't push it. I mean if you don't get up for the girl in the bus please do stand up for the old lady. 20. How to be a jerk by being a nice guy? The best things in life hurt more than the bad things. They hurt but are pleasant things. What do I mean ? Like having a chat with an old person on the park bench will probably make your girlfriend want to cry. Or playing with children. There are many good things that you can do but you've got to believe in what you do. You have to do the good thing not for you but for the person you do it for and really believe you're doing for the other person. A selfless act. Why should you be a jerk by doing this? Well if you can't remember your girlfriend's birthday you are a jerk but by doing a good thing you're even a bigger jerk because you are unpredictable and there is a very nice person in you who can't be given up. Try to balance everything.21. See a crippled person who does not treat you in the right fashion? Just tell them. Just because they are in a wheelchair or something doesn't mean they can be arrogant to you. No way feel sorry for them. That's up to them. It's not your business.22. Emotional manipulation (not necessarily jerk-material.); questions like: "Have you eaten?" "How are you feeling?" "How's your mom doing?" score high.23. In movies they (the "cool" guy) say "I don't deserve you" or "I can't live without you." Bullsh*t. Only weak guys say this. You just say (if it's necessary) "Oh sweetie I can live without you but it would be different (you thinking: maybe even better.)24. Learn about pokerfaces. Watch Richard Donner's "Maverick" with Mel Gibson.You'll learn something about facial expressions.25. Hang around with the guys who are good at seducing. This will accelerate your evolutionprocess. It has something to do with being in a morphogenetic field. Further reading: Rupert Sheldrake's books. It also explains why people can sense someone looking at them. There is even scientific evidence for this paranormal phenomenon. Suppl #2: Being Fox Mulder.How to gain Confidence1. Listen to everyone. Just dont even care if theyre boring or not. 2. Leave your house in clean shape. Stay clean inside too.3. Respect your parents. However sometimes theyre also full of crap. 4. Dont have an opinion about people until you have sufficient information about them. The nerd may become your baseball-friend one day.5. Have a goal. It will drive you and give you purpose. No matter how simple that goal is.6. Have eye-contact with all people: in different forms. When youre walking through a crowded place all you have to do is look them in the eye (and think go aside) and they will go out of your way. Do it quite often so that you dont forget the things Ive learned. It is also practice to evolve your skills. Look and smile to women to make them happy, even if it is for a very brief period.7. Joke about your flaws. Try to eliminate them at the same time. Thats also how George W. Bush got many people behind him. 8. Learn from everyone and everything. Read womens magazines and websites to learn how they think. Try to learn about and from everything. Like making cocktails, dancing, making jokes, coping with people who you a hard time. Learn how to protect yourself by observing animals (how wushu was developed.) Observe plants to learn how they grow. You may need the knowledge some day.9. Everyone is a human being. We can all die on a cherry that gets stuck in our throats. So dont fear the bodybuilder. Women have their monthly problems. Be open about it. If you cant get an erection for once its no big deal. Youre human. 10. Dont be afraid of making mistakes. It is an efficient form of education.11. Do your best in bed. Word will spread among the female population that you are a sexgod.12. Learn what women like. Usually that is; icecream (preferably chocolate flavour), soft stuff, a guy with charisma and good sex. Not every woman is the same so learn a wide variety of things that women like. Eating, lovemaking, places to go. Women are complex beings so do your best to learn the things they like.13. Never trust anyone with important things.14. Be crazy and enjoy it.You can beat anyone by being crazy. Oh but also show that your common sense outweighs your crazy side.15. Walk straight. 16. If anti-confidence builds up; listen to music that makes you feel better. Maybe that is house music or hardrock. Blues is manly music. And music like American Woman (The Guess Who), The Darth Vader Theme (John Williams (Star Wars episodes V and VI soundtrack,)) O Fortuna (Carl Orff) work fine. Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett do well.17. Absolute confidence boost to a heterosexual male: Get to learn all the prettiest women in the neighborhood. Watch the guys when you say Hi to her. So be surrounded by pretty girls. As you know many of them are feeling so lonely theyll never admit it. Even the ones with boyfriends.18.  Shut up and leave the girl alone when you are drunk.19. Have kleenex, mints, a lighter (those cool metallic ones or an original one) and money on you. 20. Learn how to read someones face. There are a lot of books about it. 21. Accept your fettish sides. You can be turned on by leather clothing, urinating women, ordinary underwear instead of sexy lingery. YOU ARE HUMAN. However sex with the too young or having thoughts about it IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.22. Having nothing to lose. Do not have addictions. But things like using medicines and wearing glasses must be accepted.23. Remember that sometimes the best response is to say nothing at all. Also very good to irritate.24. Observe and learn what peoples fears and weak spots are. It will make you feel you are not that different from them. You also would have the proper knowledge to beat them in a confrontation. 25. Believe in what you are doing. Even if youve made a mistake.26. A little quantumphysics:You are the man. If you would not have been born then the universe wouldnt have existed. Think about Schrodingers Cat. The universe both exists and not exists before birth. When you get born the universe exists. When you would not have been born the universe would not have existed. The universe how you know it only exists for you.27.  Be full of sarcasm. Be romantic. Be an idiot. Be loving. Be crazy. Be romantic. Live life to fullest. Spend much time with old people who love you. Dont be sorry about anything. Explore your body (there could be a world champion breakdancer in you.)  In short be unpredictable and make your life fun to live.28. Talk with different types of humans. Have friends (no need to be best friends) among different types.29. Be ready to adapt to everything. Your life can suddenly change into a nightmare. Dont be pessimistic about it. It is inprobable that it will become a nightmare.Clint Eastwood:Opinions are like assholes. Everybody has one. There was a broken link in the Don Juan Bible and a chaotic article I wrote under the name foxmulder (don't use it anymore.) Both are in better form. The first part is new material.------------------a.k.a. bartender

    <h3>
    EXAMPLES OF COCKY + FUNNY 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Now we all know that cocky+funny = wet panties.So, the question arises - how do you actually come across as cocky and funny? The first most important thing is, do not try to get her panties wet - instead, just decide that you're going to have as much fun RIGHT NOW as you can while you're with the gal - forget the scheming and plotting. Just play with her words, rag on her, bust her on her choice of words, liberal doses of sarcasm and humor so that she's laughing and still a bit nervous (in a GOOD way) about how you'll tease her next.Now that you know what frame of mind to approach in, you need some examples. The idea here is to show that you're VERY confident with yourself, are going to make fun of her every chance you get (not annoy - TEASE) and you you're think you're the best thing in the world - but, you're also going to be funny so that she laughs and doesn't get turned off.Lets go over some examples:A favourite of mine from Take No Dirt:You: Tonight is your lucky nightHer: Oh really? Why is that?You: Because you finally got to go out with meHer: Sure! <if you said it right, she's going to be smiling by now!>You: But no touching - *I* do all the touching!This one is field tested - it works magic! Gets her laughing, she might even punch you for it playfully which means she's started the KINO. Thats your cue to take up the KINO one more notch...   Another example would be while setting up a date:Me: Lets go out for coffee and some stimulating conversation... that way if I dont like you at all, I can claim I need to floss my dog's teeth <or some other obvious bullshyt> and leave!You can only say these after you have some sort of rapport going though, otherwise it wont have the intended humorous effect and you'll piss her off - which is NOT what you want! The idea is to make her laugh, while being arrogant!The point is, don't waste time to start being cocky and funny - if you don't, you come across as boring and get LJBFed. So you say one or two things (positive ones) to warm her up, and before things start stagnating, you start the cocky+funny angle to set the right tone.One more example I got from the doubleyourdating mailbag was this one:Guy sees chick sitting with two of her friends checking him out. Now we all know that approaching a chick when she's with her c*ckblocking friends is tough... so what does he do?He walks over to her, she gets the "What the hell is he doing?" look on her face as he's approaching and then he joins the three girls at their table, and says to the girl "Hi there, I know I'm pretty and that you are attracted to me, but could you maybe hide your impulses?". Of course this was said in a funny way, with a cocky look. Her friends started laughing and said, "she was that obvious , huh?"Needless to say it was smooth sailing for him from this point on.Just make sure the delivery is light, fun and casual - put her on the spot while making her laugh and she won't be able to resist you! Remember, you're not there to piss her off... you're there to make her laugh, and if you get her laughing at herself... heh, you're home baby.What about you guys? Pitch in with some ideas and examples on cocky+funny... it helps everyone's game tremendously![This message has been edited by indy (edited 02-23-2002).]

    <h3>
    Proof that Confidence is More Obvious Than You Think 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


I was at a club with a friend saturday, sitting outside for a break, enjoying the cool air and a brief rest from dancing. A talkative gay man approaches and begins talking to my (female) friend and I.It was a long conversation and this guy was a character and a half, well worth a novel unto himself...but that's not the point. I was feeling strong and confident all night and I was genuinely relaxing...even with my guard down, he finally tells me,"I like you. You're different. I can tell by looking at you that you don't give a f*ck about anything. You're going to do what you want to do and everyone who doesn't like it can just f*ck off. I can tell because I'm the same way."Was it a line? Who knows. Does it matter? Not in the slightest. You see, either way, he recognized my confidence and reacted to it...regardless of his intentions.This is exactly the image I'm trying to portray. I read advice here and there about how to present your body language...look, don't look...act aloof, whatever. I just don't subscribe to this stuff. Maybe this doesn't work for everyone, but this is how I approach this...When I see a woman I like in a club, I make sure she knows it. I watch her walk. I look at her shoes, her dress, her hair. I am obvious and unapologetic about it...but my eyes don't leer, they appreciate. She's not an object, she's a woman to be explored...and that starts with my eyes. I watch her as if I'm looking at the most beautiful creature ever and I simply appreciate that moment. If she smiles, I smile. If her boyfriend gives me a look, I ignore it. I want her to know that she's on my list. Everything I do with my body language says "I like you. If you don't like the attention, that's your problem."But I'm the Alpha-Male and I don't go after just any woman. So she knows I'm interested, but she's wondering why I haven't approached yet. I find that this actually weeds out a lot of women because they get nervous or freaked out or whatever...but damn, I'm not interested in those women anyway. They may look good, but a LOT of women look good...and there are more than enough women willing to fight for my attention. After a decent amount of time (and a good selection of women), these girls know where I am and who I'm watching. Because I'm so obvious watching them, they become intrigued and begin watching me...and they see me watching, talking and dancing with other girls. I tend to see the same girls dancing in front of me or walking near me most of the night...it's magnetic. I want to see a parade and I expect a bit of effort on their part before I even say hello.I'm just beginning to explore deeper contact: dancing, conversation, etc...my focus so far has been on body language.This was probably the most arrogant approach I could come up with and that's probably the reason I'm sticking with it...Consider yourself a prize and you're only worthy of the best, right?Does it work? Hrm...still mixed. Honestly, I'm more concerned with attitude and presentation than closing the deal at this point. I have a different approach than most, but I definitely have a plan and I've been sticking to that plan for the past month or so. My motivation is just different. For me, this is as much about personal development as it is about getting laid. That's just the bonus.So what's the point of all this? For me, the point is that if you have an image in your head of who you want to be and you stick to it, you can be that person...you can grow this way...you can achieve this change in your personality. I can feel my personal strength growing every day...maybe slowly, but growing.I don't want a new image...I don't want a facade. I want a new Me. That new Me has to be complete and thorough...so extreme measures are necessary. This is my approach, but I think some of these things may be useful to others. Hope it helps someone.

    <h3>
    true story about being a challenge 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Ok, about a year and whatever ago, I ran track and I didn't have a care in the world, not women, not money, not anything...then I bump into this 10 girl(that seemed to find my wits charming) and I tell her up front that I don't want a relationship or anything(cuz my full attention was at training for the fall cross country season)...so then she pursues me more and more. She begs me to come to her b-party, I decline giving some excuse. You know what she said? "you're the first guy who hasn't pursued me like all my exs." Then she emails me, talks about me to her friends and before you know it we're makin' out in her house. Then I tell her we can only be a fling for the summer...first she is very upset and argumentative, but she then writes back telling me if that's all I can give, then she'll take it, that I am so "sweet and caring" and blah, blah. She spent the whole summer trying to convince me to make us more than a fling.Take notes...I was a challenge without even knowing it. But I became far less of a challenge as I gave in. I saw her more often in the summer (every single weekend, and I ditched my other friends' plans for her) and I NEVER TRAINED FOR THE TEAM IN THE FALL LIKE I WANTED TO. I DIDN'T EVEN MAKE THE TEAM CUZ I WAS PUTTING A LOT OF TIME INTO THIS GIRL. She wanted me to stop running and I did, for a while. (more evidence of being whipped)  After a while, I saw a different side of her, the angry b#tchy side. Don't get me wrong, she normally was a very nice girl and that's the reason I thought I had to become super nice and treat her well and come to her every whim. Well, eventually she gave me the boot and I was devastated...I hadn't run in months, I was off the team, and my grades were horrible. She later told me that the "spark" was gone. I had her LAST on my priorities when I first met her. For some strange reason, this made her want me more. She would write me these huge emails about how she missed me and blah blah. Anyway, I am back to running now, grades are better, and after reading some of the stuff on here, way more understanding when it comes to women. I had lost control of my life to a girl and I am just tellin' ya even the nicest of girls will pull the plug on you if you don't keep her guessing and leave her wanting more. The way you do that is simple...just keep doing whatever you were doing before you met her...sports..anything.DON'T EVER GIVE IT UP FOR HER! That'll show her that even if she dumps you, you are still happy and you wouldn't give a two-bit damn because you're occupied with your own life.  -true story!

    <h3>
    What I've learned... 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


I know everyone has different objectives on this forum. Mine was a long term relationship.After being away from this forum for a long while, I've realized what I think are conclusive things.Anti-Dump is right all the way. Speed seduction, for the case of long term relationships, is worthless.I would get results with speed seduction. But I might as well have been an actor. I enjoyed getting responses, but I was never happy.Forget NLP, forget Speed Seduction, unless you wish to practice them all your life. For a long term relationship, they are worthless.Anti-Dump and the advice on the website is much much better and actually works.I have flaws, as does anyone else. Speed seduction could veil them, but I want to be accepted for myself and my flaws as well. True love demands the acceptance of the entire package.Here's what I noticed to be extremely effective:1) Go for the number, go for the date. (Guys should not flirt. Women flirt. The job of guys is to ask for the number and to call for the date. This cuts through all women's games.)2) Don't talk about yourself! (Focus the conversation on her or on her interests. Only mention things about you if they are the same: "Yes, I think the same about parrots being evil too." So many women have said that I'm a 'mystery'. "Is this good?" "Yes" This is because when I do comment on myself, it is very vague and general. I keep my mouth shut. Also, you come across as a good listener. A good listener is the most sexiest trait a guy can have.)3) Demand respect! (She may not give you her company, she may not give you her affection, but she should always, and I mean always, give you her respect. Women will not stay with guys they don't respect, and you wouldn't want to be with a woman that didn't respect you anyway.)4) Don't be afraid to disagree. (This runs contrary to Speed Seduction. No, do not seek disagreements. If possible, try to bypass them. But never be afraid to disagree. Women want guys who have a mind of their own.)5) Women are never the priority. (Your life is more important. Women take a backseat to your passions and hobbies. Failure to do this makes you desperate.)Most imporantly, be yourself. Speed seduction will not give you happiness. You want to be accepted for who you are, not because you memorized patterns and lines from an internet website. Being yourself does not mean being a shy sniveling nice guy, it also includes self improvement.You cannot 'act' yourself into happiness. Away with the NLP! Away with the Speed Seduction! Being yourself may give you more failures in dating, but it is the only path to true happiness.Pook"As you think, you shall become.""Men will be nice when nice guys get laid."-----------------------------[This message has been updated by Monsieur Pookiness on 07-25-2002).]Why the update? There are always updates because you never stop learning.Of Self-ImprovementBy putting the focus on you, rather than the women, you DO gain a control on your life. Most people sleep-walk through life. Others figure out what women want and, like clay, remold themselves to that. But by focusing on yourself, you keep yourself from ever being desperate and, even if things do NOT work out with a particular woman or women, you are still better for it since you haven't stopped upgrading yourself.At every work place since the 'Kill that Desperation' post, I always enter being one way and leave another. For example, one job I enter being 'kinda' cute to the girls there. I leave being 'pretty damn cute' and enter the next job at the same level. Eventually, I become 'hot' and leave to the next. (And I was a computer geek! If I could turn myself from a nerd to a stud, then anything is possible!)In all your dealings with women, YOU are the only constant. Changing in how you think leads to a more correct action. A sound mind creates sound attraction.I won't lie; self-improvement will get you no girls. But it does make it MUCH EASIER to obtain girls. If you don't have the balls to risk than nothing you can do will get girls. Nothing.One thing that hasn't been stressed enough here is SOCIAL-IMPROVEMENT. This is beyond how to talk to a chick. This is being OUTGOING (which is hard to do when you are reading DJ posts. It's a classic Catch 22). Yes, you can read and be Mr. Smart. Yes, you can pump weights and be tough. But if you aren't outgoing, you will still be SINGLE.Many guys here will fit this description: they are good-looking and know it. They are fit. They know they want a cutie. But, alas, there is a problem. It is not that they are shy; they have overgrown that. It is not that they are ugly; they are adonises. No, it is that they are imprisoned in their own homes. "Ask her out." To what!? What should they do? They feel uncomfortable since it is not what they usually do.The only way to do something with confidence and with ease is to do it often. The Don Juan is not a mental trick, NLP, or script but a HABIT. Aristotle says, "We are the sum of our habits." You cannot read what is on this site and expect results. Habit is central. (And habits change from HOW you think!)To those guys plagued with an icy fear on what to do when dating and all, they should date themselves. Literally try taking yourself out. What would you do? What is the plan? The focus is fun. If usual dates don't come to your liking, then choose what YOU want to do."But Pook! She may not like what I want!"But YOU are the focus. As Anti-Dump always said, she MUST like your date ideas. If she says no, then oh well! If she does, then you two like doing the same things together! Dating is a machine to cycle through all the chicks and get you the one that fits. It is not a bending over backward to please the girl and 'woo' her.Of SeductionIt can be wise not to seduce too fast, to not get her between your sheets ASAP. Patience is always a good thing and lets things grow between you two.Confident guys are confident because they know that it will come. If it is not now, then it will come. If it will come, then it is not now. Yet, it will come. I think patience has been the biggest element to my success than anything else.Of RiskWhy are you here at this site? For most guys, it is because they fell in love with a woman who tore his heart to pieces. Now they devour Don Juan material so it can never happen again. They never emotionally risk again; they just utilize scripts and philosophies.Emotional risk is not stupid AFC stuff like calling all the time. It is not getting sappy. It is putting your ego on the line. Why should you do this? Because there is a greater risk than if you don't. Why have a woman if all you don't invest some of your emotion in it? It ruins the fun and the love."But Pook! You said be desireless!" Desireless means controlling yourself rather than having her control you. And this is at the beginning. After a while with a girl, you SHOULD want to put some emotional attachment in."But what if I get hurt!?" Then you still win! Would you be here at this forum, learning how to be a Don Juan, if you got the woman you wanted?You should thank the girl you didn't get because now you are a Don Juan. (Imagine if you were an AFC for your entire life! Yech!) If something similiar occurs, the same radical improvement will follow.Do not use DJism as an armor for the risk of emotional attachment. DJing is a TOOL to a goal. The goal is not DJism itself.Dating is a Win-WinDo not look at women as a win or lose game. THE GOAL is to find a woman you love and one who loves you back (without either settling). The goal is NOT to make every chick like you. The goal is to make YOURSELF happy. Think of it as a weeding out process where THE ONE is at the end.Every breath we take brings us one closer to our last. What are you waiting for? For yourself to become 'perfect'? You never will be. The key is to weed them out to find if she is perfect for you.Do not try to get into a woman's head. I've done so and I've wasted countless time in the process. Women are meant to be loved, not understood. If you understand them, you can never love them. So choose to love them; it's a happier life than that of a dried up philosopher.There is nothing to lose. Success is a certainty now. Turn off the computer, go out, and live.[This message has been edited by Pook (edited 07-25-2002).]

THE MANIPULATIVE, COLD HEARTED MAN WITH TITSThis little MANIPULATIVE, COLD HEARTED MAN WITH TITS/ENGLISH dictionnary (or bullsh!t detector) is the result of my direct experience. Feel free to post your entries. ORIGINALLY POSTED BY THE CYNICAL MAN quote: You see, American women (my country) are spoiled. They get everything they want at an early age and it continues from there. They don't appreciate anything. As they get older they realize the power they have over guys (only if you let them), and use it to their advantage.Here's the trick: When caught, they hide behind their 'sugar and spice' (ACTION's words) facade and we men let them get away with practically murder.This is the double-standard out there. I like to call women like this, "Men with tits" cuz they think like a big-time jerk guy, but in the body of a woman. Very dangerous, to say the least.I say only by sticking to the basics, and dealing out the BOTTOM LINE if there's a problem, can you effectively weed out the bazillion useless manipulative women out there and find a good one.She gives you all the signals but keeps talking about her BF :Translation : " I have a comfortable relationship with my BF (hes rich/hes got a big car/d!ck, whatever). I wont leave him for you, but flirting with losers like you is my favorite hobby. I like to feel desirable, beautiful, lovable. Once you are hooked, I mention my BF and Gosh do I love to see that desperation in your eyes! Jubilation! Ohthe poor little teddy bear has a crush on me. Oh you are so cute "Shes attracted to you, but shes also saying " Lets just be friends for a while. I dont want to jump into anything right away because whenever Ive done that in the past, things just didn't work out. Blah blah blah. " Translation : " I am manipulative and cold hearted. I know that if I admit Im not attracted to you, then you'll bail. The next week, month, year, decade, whatever, Im gonna tell you that I finally met the man of my dreams and that I owe it all to you. As you can see, my beauty and platonic affection for you are reminiscent of a fine chocolate coating on a big piece of dung. Want a bite? " She has a boyfriend on the side, but (WOW!) shes ready to leave him for you. Translation : Im giving you a big flat clue on my honesty and loyalty. I love you so much You can trust me! Ha! I have no integrity, and I love it! Hopefully, you are too dumb to see that Im a taker. I dont have the guts to tell my current boyfriend that I want to end it before I get involved with you. Im a little monkey with tits ; I won't let go of one branch till I get a grip on the next. When it gets boring with you, Im gonna do the exact same thing. But dont listen to your bullsh!t detector! Everything is all right. Yeah, thats right, look at my tits "" Friday night? Im afraid I cant because blah blah blah blah. But call me next week. "Translation : " You turn me off. But call me next week, because I dont have the guts to tell you that Id rather sleep with a road apple. Besides, I can still tell my friend that this loser is after me. Oh you boost my ego! Ohhhhhh yeah! Yeeeessssss! Ohhhhhhhhhh! But this is the only pleasure you can give me, so back off.I never kiss on the first date."Wow. What a great night weve had together. Thank you! Its so boring to be alone.. But you turn me off. Oh! Thanks for everything. You are wonderful! Im so full of crap, but when Im with you, I feel like gold. You are my hero.. but dont forget you turn me off."[quote] ORIGINALLY POSTED BY SURVIVOR)There's this woman I met over the Internet. We'll call her Gina. We exchanged pictures and phone numbers. She seemed attractive (pretty face, brickhouse body, Yum!) so I called and asked out on an action date to a restaurant that has a gameroom in the back. She agreed. That was was two days ago.This morning however, I get this email from Gina:quote:------------------------------------------------------------------------[b]Whatsup Survivor? Just thought I would drop you a few lines to say hi. I hope you had a wonderful week. Thinking about our date on Saturday. Looking forward to meeting you. There's one thing. ( I'm trying to make a long story short) I think I mentioned our students are going to a 5 Star Restaurant on Friday 5/18. That's why I'm still up. Anyway, the two gentleman who mentored and financed the dinner for our students are having a BBQ on Saturday. They are both ministers. One is graduating from Seminary. Instead of going out and beating you (SMILE) at Skeeball I would like you to be my guest. Let me know your take on this. Call me or e-mail me.Talk To You Soon........GINA Translation"I am still curious about meeting you Survivor, but since you either talked with me on the phone too long (10-15 min.) or said something stupid in the conversation, my curiousity in you isn't high enough to want to be with you alone, even if it is in a neutral, safe, public place. When I meet you for the first time, I would like to have some backup. Therefore I want us to meet where I can have HOMEFIELD ADVANTAGE. Instead of having only me evaluate you, you will be TRIPLE-TEAMED by myself and two ministers that I've already spoken with concerning you. And who knows how many other people will be grilling you with questions.And yes Survivor my dear, I am purposely placing you in this stressful situation to see how you deal with it. If you choose to go to the BBQ, I'll think that I can probably get you to do anything I want at a moment's notice, and thus lose respect for you. If you choose NOT to go, I'll probably assume that you were intimidated by the situation and chickened out. And you'll still lose any chance you had with me. It's a lose-lose situation for you, win-win for me!Isn't Internet dating wonderful! (SMILE) Call me or email later so I'll know whether or not you're gullible enough to fall for this BS stunt I'm pulling.Talk To You Soon........GINA ------------------Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.- Roosevelt[This message has been edited by CHALENGE GUY (edited 05-20-2001).]

    <h3>
    Getting her on YOUR turf 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


After a wild night out last night, my buddy and I were talking about how to approach women in a club.One method that works for him is to simply reach over and pull her to him. I have never seen him get rejected this way.The approach that we both agreed to be the best, is to motion for her to come over to you.Doing this accomplishes several things. First and foremost you are showing supreme confidence. Not too many guys have the balls to do this.Secondly, you are showing dominance. We all know that women love dominant males.Third of all, you are putting her on your turf. She is crossing the line moving away from her personal space and into yours. If she moves to you, she has shown submissive behaviour. From this point on you are in control.Think about this for a minute. If you had walked over to her and asked her to dance, she has control. If you had approached her where she was standing, even if you weren't "asking" her to dance the ball is still in her court. But if she leaves her comfort zone to enter your territory, you are 100% in control. You have showed her that you aren't afraid to be in control and take what you want. Of course there is a small chance that she won't "obey". So what? You have established that she's not interested. Move on.This technique will only work when you are on top of your game. Your success rate will be proportionate to the amount of confidence you project. If she detects hesitation or weakness on your part failure is likely.The "grab her hand and pull her to you" method will work best on a girl that you haven't necessarily made eye contact with. The "motion her to you" method will require getting her attention one way or another preferrably with a smile and eye contact.Try this sometime. Done properly it should yeild a pretty good return.

    Breaking Free 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Hi guys Simo' here. I only found this site 2 days ago and I must say top stuff. If only they tauhgt this stuff in schools. It gladdens my heart to see men getting together and sharing their experiences in the name of self improvement. I work on a 3 strikes and I am out principle. This applies to all areas of my life not just in matters of the fairer sex. But seeing as that is the focus of this site I will share my experiences in this area. 18 months ago saw the end of the 3rd long term relationship for me. This last one leaving me with a daughter that I am no longer allowed to see. There is nothing more devastating than to be allowed to hold your child once then have her taken away. I had every right to be bitter but I chose to look within instead.I decided that If I could not have a happy relatlionship with a woman then I would learn to live without. I asked myself could I be happy without a woman in my life. This is not to say I did not want one I just did not want to be unhappy ever again. So I started dreaming of the things I wanted to do with my life. And there began the journey to freedom. Once I had life goals that had meaning to me, instead of ones I thought I needed to follow just to impress the babes,my life started to change. I started to pursue financial freedom so as to be able to afford my goals and peak physical fitness so as to have the energy to achieve them. Basically I am busy building my foundations, on top of wich I will build my grandest version of my grandest vision of what I can become in this life time.  'Surprise' 'Surprise' there's women comming from every where. I am not saying that I am slaying babes left right and centre, I am saying that many are getting interested and I have not done one bit of chasing. The bottom line is that when you focus on your own inner greatness your inner light begins to shine and like moths to a flame people will be attracted to you. When your only motivation in life is to discover your own greatness  ,then you do not want or need anything from others, so they feel safe to be around you.When you stride out with the strength of your purpose every day people will follow for so few no where they are going.When people see you toil from dusk till dawn without expecting any reward they will come to ask why.When you can stand tall within yourself and know who you trully are, then you will unconciously give those around you permission to do the same. Just concentrate on discovering yourself. You will automatically become purposefull,charming,mysterious etc. A great man lies in all men but only you yourself can find him. It is the road less travelled.Only about 10% of people follow it but the rewards are great, for those 10% stand out from the crowd.  And don't worry about the chicks. When you know yourself you get to pick and choose from the girls who also have had the courage to know themselves and they are the quality ones.

    You wanted Drills?  You got 'em? 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


I believe my age (26) as well as my status as an average looking guy that gets beautiful women, and time spend tending bar make me eligible to assign some drills in ascending order of difficulty (pardon my arrogance).I believe meeting girls is a skill that can be learned... not intellectually, but like a sport... where one becomes accustomed to the "feel" of picking up women like the "feel" of a golf or tennis swing.  It is not a purely intellectual action, in my opinionDrill #1Complement 10 women throughout the day and immediately move on.  The catch is... it can't be general, vague, or over the top.  You need to mention small but specific things.  "you are so beautiful"  doesn't work because it's obvious B.S... that you can (and in her mind do) use on every woman.  She will delight in rejecting you for your egotistical Don Juan ways. If a woman has an unusual pin, hairstyle, doormat, nose ring... mention it.  The reason she's wearing it is for attention.After the small, but specific compliment... move on like you think nothing of it.  The art of seducing a woman is making her feel special around you... and making her desperate to get that feeling.  If she feels special around you, she's going to want to feel that way again.This is a small but vital skill that, it seems to me, every successful Don Juan has.  The ability to talk casually to women... you need to get used to doing it if you are going to be successful. Its okay if the women are old, ugly, fat (they need attention too).  The point is not getting laid... its getting used to talking.  Please, let me know if this is helpful... also, posting experiences and questions would certainly help us all.  There's no prize, but let's see who comes up with the most unique, subtle, and individualized compliment...  Also, let me know if anyone is interested in more drills... I actually have two friends that wanted to be more successful with women... did some drills, both are much more successful...See everyone around...

    Never do this!!!

    <p>
    


Ok, so you got this great girl and you've been dating her for 4 months or so.  You have a great time but every once in a while you have your lovers' quarrels.  She wants you to hang out with her friends suggesting you all go out and have a great time at a bar.  To you this sounds like fun... You and 3 or 4 babes going drinking and having a blast.BE CAREFUL!!!! IT'S A TRAP!!!!The friends are watching you're every move at this point and deep down inside the one's that don't have boyfriends will secretly despise what you and your girl have going. (You know how girls are).They will do a lot of things to make you get pissed off.  They will flirt with you to make your girlfriend jealous and cause a fight.  They will get her drunk enough to make her do stupid things like dance with another guy.  They will talk about other guys in front of you to make you uncomfortable.  But it works... trust me it happened to me.. You end up having an argument with your girlfriend in front of them and this is where you blow it.  They now have sufficient ammunition to hate you and convince your girlfriend that you are not right for her.  Then they'll start reminding her of how much fun they had when they were single and the rest is history.  All because women in general are spiteful, jealous and vindictive.  Just a warning....

Anyway today was my first real chance to meet her so here's what I did.We're walking towards each other in the hallway so I stop her.Me: Hi, what's your name?Her: TanyaMe: Hi Tanya, I've been noticing that you're by far the loveliest girl that works here and I wanted to meet you.Well that was all it took. She was very flattered and got all flustered at this point. She threw out "Thank You!" and then, as if she wasn't sure what to do, took a couple steps in the direction she was going and then stopped and took a step back to talk to me. I just made fluff talk asking about her job and what not. The great part was how I was all cool and confident while she was clearly a bit nervous. She talked a little too fast and made slightly exaggerated hand gestures and head movements, signs of nervousness.Now I'm just a regular guy and I was dressed in a t-shirt and slighty dirty jeans. And here was the Hottest Babe around acting as if she had just met the greatest stud in the world.I've used that approach two other times recently and it had a simliar effect on the women involved. From now on it's about the only approach I'm going to use all the time. It works great and it's easy to do!

    <h3>
    Always take advantage of opportunities to meet women 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


1.  Will every opportunity to meet single women be successful?  No, but when you develop the attitude of refusing to allow temporary setbacks to defeat you, you have what it takes to successfully meet and attract women.  Persistence always prevails in the end when it comes to scoring with single women. 2.  Never, never wait for something to happen to help you meet women - You make it happen!  You take action!  Always be prepared to take action when you see an opportunity to meet girls.  You will be amazed at how your luck will change when you have this mindset. 3.  Success with women always involves risks.  You must take that chance in approaching women.  Don't let shyness or fear of rejection holds you back.  Go for it!  You can do it!  You must actively seek opportunities to make a love connection! 4.  This last tip is the most important one of all: You've got to be prepared to act as soon as you recognize opportunities to meet single women.  Don't put it off.  Approach all those hot & sexy honeys as soon as the opportunity presents itself. In closing, I know this has probably happened to you.  You see this gorgeous babe you'd love to get to know better, but you can't get up your nerve to approach her.  Then she disappears and you could kick yourself in the ass for not having the balls to approach her. Don Diebel------------------"Women. They've got half the money in the world and all the pu$$y."

    <h3>
    The turn
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Often, when a girl gets mad at a guy for something he did, the guy totally blows it by begging her for her forgiveness.  This gives her all the power and keeps him in the wrong.There is a way to turn this around though. So much so that you doing something wrong can actually be a good thing! The trick is to first not show any guilt, dont let her know you feel like you did something wrong. Secondly you need to find something you can be mad at her about and focus on that. When a girl is put on the defensive its amazing how quickly they can forget about how mad they were at you. All they will be thinking about is how to not have you upset with them. They will in turn end up begging you for your forgiveness.For example, the other night, this girl who i dont know got on the computer WITH my girlfriend and her friend right there, i of course had no clue my girlfriend was right there reading everything i said. This girl started asking me questions, one of which was if i was dating anybody, i said i was dating a few girls. She then let me know that she knew my girlfriend and that she was sitting right there with her reading what i said. They apparently were trying to find out bad stuff about me so that my girlfriend wouldnt get hurt.After that I was thinking, oh crap, I screwed myself this time. I had three girls extremely pissed off at me, and the girl that im involved with went into another room crying. At first all I could think to do was to call her up and apologize. Meanwhile the girls went over to another house so I had some time to think of what I should do. The main thing that came to my mind was that I was losing control, that the girl was getting the ball in her court. I needed to step up and take the control back.How could I do this? I had three girls extremely pissed off at me, not to mention the fact that I was made a fool of by the way I got played. Then it came to me, I could dump her right then and there! Drastic you think? Maybe, but I had a feeling it would turn things around.When the girl got back on instant messenger I started things off with, ok, im sorry you got hurt, but you know that shouldnt of hurt you, you know how I feel about you. But im not going to give you any excuses for me dating other girls, because i dont need to, if you are going to be like this now theres no way i can be with you, for one thing, i have a zero tolerance for girls that play stupid games like that, secondly, you do not trust me. What this did was focus the wrong on her, I acted mad at her because she played a game on me, and I was not going to put up with it. I then said im breaking this off right now, your getting too far into this, ive been trying to take it slow with you so that you wouldnt get hurt, but you are. I was dating other girls way before me and you got involved.  This worked perfectly, first it showed that I didnt need her, that I had other girls, and she ended up begging me not to be mad at her and leave her. Later on in the night I talked to the other girls that were mad at me. What I did with them was chew them out for playing a stupid game like that; I acted like I was extremely pissed. They ended up actually pleading with me not to be mad at them. I couldnt believe how well I was actually able to turn things around. I started off with the girl im dating ready to leave me, and her two friends pissed off at me. By the end of the night the girl had begged me to not be upset with her and to not leave her, and her two friends were actually relieved that I forgave them.Let this be a lesson guys. You are THE MAN; you have the power to take things wherever you choose. Do not let yourselves be controlled by women. Never beg; never give in out of fear that you will loose them. Force them to give in out of fear that they will loose you.*Note, this mostly applies to the younger guys here.LittleDon[This message has been edited by LittleDon (edited 08-12-2000).][This message has been edited by LittleDon (edited 08-12-2000).]

    <h3>
    More club tips and tactics 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


As I may have mentioned before, I go to clubs fairly regularly.Here are a couple of observations.#1 Easy intro.  I fell into this intro line without even realizing it. I walked up to the bar to get a drink, there were two hotties already there waiting for the bartender. I pulled a $20 out and held it out to let the bartender know I needed a drink. My buddy was laughing at me, but money gets anyones attention. I caught the bartender's attention before the ladies did, so I motioned toward them and said, "The ladies were here first" in a strong tone of voice. For a split second the girls probably thought I was being rude for jumping in that way,  but I got a nice smile and a "thank you" that she repeated twice to make sure I heard her. For anyone who has problems approaching women in clubs this is the perfect way in. Can breaking the ice get any easier? You have already gained rapport without even saying a word to her. You didn't come up to the bar to hit on her, (or so she thinks) so it's a natural progression to a convo.  Now all you have to do is run with it. You have already melted her b!tch sheild, so the rest is easy. #2 Make you presence known. My buddy accomplishes this by yelling "WOOOO" on the dance floor at the top of his lungs. I know it sounds silly but it works! The girlies giggle and look over to see who it is having a good time. From that point on it's easy to get them to dance with you.#3 Move thru the club like you are on a mission. I mentioned this before in another post awhile ago, and had it confirmed again last night. When you go to the little boys room, don't look side to side and stare at every pair of breasts that walk by. Instead, look straight ahead, dance a little while you walk. Anytime I have been stopped by women in a club or bar it has been when I am NOT focused on checking them out. You should  be the one making the approach, but it's a great confidence booster to have a few eyeing you during the night. #4  You are THE MAN. Take what you want and have no regrets. I'm sure you have all heard this before but I want to give an example. My psychotherapist friend spotted a FINE brunette one night and proceeded to make eye contact. Next he moved closer and started dancing ass to ass with her. Big deal, you say? Here's the kicker. She was with her BOYFRIEND! That's nothing. Later on in the night she went so far as to let him rub her pu$$y while she was still dancing with her boyfriend! (the floor was crowded so he got away with it)  Pretty risky to say the least, but it just goes to show what you can pull off if you got the balls to try.

    More of stuff you never thought about... 
    </h3>

Hey everyone,I love this board.. I've learned a lot.  And I figured I can share a lot.  There are a lot of intelligent guys that read this board too which makes it very satisfying when I offer socio-philosophical ideas about us as a male species (see the post about the "pussification" of the American Male).  However, I am 25 and have had quite a share of the female experience (29 and counting) so I can offer help from my previous hits and MANY misses.  Also, I like to include things that have otherwise not been posted previously.  Ok... here goes:1)  Everyone's advice here is good but they are forgetting one important thing.  Maybe it's taboo to say, but let's face it:  Not everyone here is as good looking as another.  There.. I said it.  Now deal with it.  Some of us may be a 10 with no game who the D.J. techniques will work better for.  However, some of may be a 5 or below and all the techniques in the world won't help a bit in the place where it counts... the initial approach.  If you are insecure about your looks it will make it all that more difficult to approach that cutie you constantly see.  Now you can't change the mug that God gave you but you can do something too help yourself raise a couple of notches.  A little fat?  Quit eating so many carbs, chubster!  Hair looks like a chia pet?  Spend 60 bucks on a salon cut (take a picture afterwards to show a barber later).  Scrawny?  Keep a couple of 20 lb barbell in your room and lift them while watching TV.  Buy an issue of Mens Health or Esquire and try to buy some clothes similar to the ads.  Look down... are you wearing ratty cross trainers?  Get some nice black shoes!  Trim that nose hair and eyebrows!  I think you get the point.  If you're a little confused just ask yourself this question... What can I do that will invoke compliments out of people?  2) If your on a dry spell (see above) the posts on the board probably make you feel more like crap.  How can you use any of the D.J. techniques if you don't even know a single girl's phone number.  You see girls out everywhere but you just can't seem to talk to them.  I've been there and I think everybody has.  The dry spell can sap your self esteem quicker than panties come off on prom night.  What you need to do is get in there any way possible.  Here are some ways:-If you have a friend that's female but that youre not attracted to, ask her if some of her friends want to go out dancing with you.  -Answer a personal ad with some girl in your area.  E-mail her and be nice and respectful.  Develop a rapport and friendship through e-mail.  Have at least 10 e-mail sessions before asking for her number.  Some may argue with this but I think she will offer her number first this way.-Online chat... (see above).  Just ask if you can e-mail her after your first chat.-If your on a bus, train, waiting room or anywhere else with seats at least sit next to a cute girl when possible.  Even if you're too much of a wuss to talk the excitement feels good.  Plus, you'll kick yourself so much after she leaves you'll swear never to do that again.  Some guys are so intimidated that they'll sit far away but with a view of her.  This is more like stalking.. you know who you are!3)This is for you High School Junior and Senior guys out there.  If you're not succeeding then quit trying to hook up with girls in your grade!!!  Forget about all those senior girls that aren't paying attention to you.. They are porking college guys after school is over.  Concentrate on the freshman and sophomore girls.  Why?  Because these girls WANT to know you.  For freshman girls knowing a senior guy, even if you're not that cool, is a status symbol to show off to her friends.  DUH!!!  Wake up and start macking on the teeny boppers.4)  If a girl you like is kind of making it difficult to hook up with her (schedule, etc.) and YOU'RE SURE that if you had another chance you can pull it off then there is a way to get her to go on a date with you.  Just say "When are you going to get your Birthday/Christmas/Hannukah present?"  She'll be like "What present?"  You say "It's nothing big.  Just a little something I got you for [occasion here]"  Just keep insisting she needs to come to your place to get it.  This works 90% of the time because you have peaked her curiosity.  If it doesn't, not only does she not like you but she's probably disgusted by you... so give it up!  What do you get her you ask?  I have to answer that too?  Nothing over 20 bucks!  A little leather diary.. a frame.. a book (Ann Gedes baby books work wonders).  However NO TEDDY BEARS or silly mushy **** like that.. It's got to have some sentiment.  Again.. keep it UNDER $20!5) If you're in college there is only one tried and sure way of getting a lot of women over your house.  HAVE A PARTY!  "But I don't wanna mess up my house, and have the cops come, and clean up, whine whine whine.."  Tough sh!t... If you have beer, some Captain Morgan, Jello shots and hunch punch the girls will start flocking to your house like flys on crap on a warm summer's day.  Have your friends pass out little flyers ONLY to girls at dorms (all girl dorms preferably).  Keep the poles away from your stash o' chicks by keeping a big dude at the door.  Ok, my brothers, that's it for now.  Thank you e-mails can be sent to my e-mail address...

I can see you, all of you guys out there who signed on to this forum hoping it would change your love life by molding you into this seducing Romeo. Well if you find the posts repetitive or the information not as useful as you once believed, maybe it's time for you to improve yourself. I'm not saying go work out to get that six-pack or improve your dress style... that's a given. I'm talking about being more intellectual, more mature than the next guy.Don't take this as a praise of nerdiness and loserdom. What I'm trying to get you guys to understand is far deeper than that. If you want to impress a woman, talking her ear off about the Super Excel XV6372 Turbo Microchip with dual processors (you get the point) isn't going to work. Instead try becoming well-read and less ignorant of the world around you.Get out there and learn a new language. Hell, learn two. Learn about a different culture or country; become a citizen of the world so to speak. Women love a smart man, so show her that you're not a dunce. Dumb guys don't last long in conversation because their topic list is limited. Besides, in this day and age, being less provincial is a good thing for people in all types of careers. Dealing with people from various backgrounds on a daily basis is rapidly becoming everyone's reality. If you're dating a woman and you want to make it more serious, know that women go into relationships often wanting to gain something from them. If you introduce her to a whole new world/culture be sure that she'll be less inclined to dump your @$$. You'll come off as different, rather as unique and she'll love you for it. You're not lot every other A&F; d*ckhead out there; your knowledge goes beyond US Politics and the NFL.While studying your new language and culture, why not travel to that country. Get to know the world. You'll have stories to tell and you wouldn't ever realize how important it is to know a nice cafe in Paris where you can take that special someone. Take a look at The Thomas Crowne Affair or any James Bond flick. These characters may have the confidence and all that other blah blah, but notice how knowledgeable they are. Notice how easy it is for them to adjust to new surroundings.If you're still not buying my advice, try this on for size- knowing a foreign language may help your chances of grabbing that exchange student before the other horny f*cks do.One last thing guys... learn how to dance, please. My eyes hurt seeing some of my peers "busting a move" on the dance floor. Try to fit this dance thing into your anthropological exploits (ie the culture-learning task I mentioned).Get at me if you need help with any Romance language, or if you have questions about which one to go for...(posted in discussion section, but I have not received any responses worth noting.)------------------Grow some balls-SKP

    <h3>
    She Can't Have Her Cake And Eat It Too 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Recently, several postings have addressed the fickleness of female decision-making.  That is, the unwillingness (conscious or otherwise) of a woman to make up her mind about anything, and about men in particular.  I'm sure you've asked yourself the question "why won't she decide to [fill in the blank]?"  Stop agonizing over the question  women do not think like you.Women are taught to believe that: (1) they have the right to keep their options open for as long as they want (i.e., no one can force them to decide); (2) they have the sole right to choose (you have nothing to say about it); and (3) they have the right to change their minds at any time (the so-called "women's perogative," without any repercussions).  I'm sure many women would disagree with one or more of these generalized beliefs, but to paraphrase numerous postings on this board, pay attention to how a woman behaves, not what she says (or types).I'm not advocating any attempt to change in these beliefs  to try doing so would be futile.  On the contrary, you need to change how you react to a woman's behavior based on any (or all) of these beliefs.1. The right to keep her options open.Single women, particularly those in their early to mid-twenties, want to "play."  They are out from under the thumb of mommy and daddy (particularly daddy), they are out of the coocoon of college, and have some means of independent financial support (with the attendant disposable income that comes along with it).  These women have no desire to "settle down" with a single guy, and operate under the belief that they have several years before they have to make a decision.  You are simply one guy out of many from which she has to choose.  She may focus on you for a time, but after she has "experienced" you, will either dispose of you or attempt to back-burner you while she experiences other guys.  The fact that she may have had sex with you is of no importance.  Once again, I'm sure many women will disagree with me, saying that a woman giving herself physically to a man is the greatest gift she can give  if this is true, then why do so many women sleep around?  Suffice it to say, she believes that what she has given to you, she can take away at her whim and give to another guy, and there is nothing you can do about it.Your reaction to this behavior should be to limit her choices in a subtle manner.  For example, if you are seeing her more than 3 times a week (and possibly having sex with her that many times a week as well), she is likely to believe that you will always be available, even if she doesn't have sex with you the next time she sees you (she thinks you will stay based on the hope of getting sex).  Begin by cutting back the number of times you see her  choose to make yourself unavailable.  If she wants to get together, but won't make up her mind when or where, give her a firm deadline.  Be prepared, she will try to make you stay available on her schedule (i.e. she will make excuses, whine, complain, cry, try kino, etc...)  No matter what she tries, however, you must be the one to limit yourself as an available choice.  She will not be motivated to make a decision unless the there is a threat that you will be unavailable as a choice.2. The sole right to chooseOnce again, women, even married ones, think that they have sole control over their lives.  When choices are taken away by someone else, however, they quickly learn that they do not have control.  This sense of being out of control puts them off-balance, causes emotional mood swings, and creates frustration.  The fact that she had sex with you (once or numerous times) is never any guaranty that she will again.  However, if you gave her something during sex (i.e. an orgasm  whichever way), that is not something she is guaranteed to receive from sex with another guy.Your reaction to this behavior is to choose for her, without telling her that she never had any choice.  For example, you ask a girl out, and she thinks she has the choice whether, where and when to go out with you.  As to the whether choice, she's right, but that's all.  You, however, have already thought about where and when.  While being flexible in scheduling a date is admirable, her schedule should not dictate yours.  That is, if you want to go to dinner at a particular restaurant on a night that you are available, then that is the choice you give her  she can either take it or leave it.  If she leaves it, you are in no different of a position than you were before.  If she accepts, you must not change the time unless her schedule coincides with yours.  If it doesn't, tell her it doesn't, and she's left with a choice.  She can change her schedule to go out with you when and where you want, or she is left with nothing.  Faced with this "choice," women with a high interest level will "choose" to go out with you on your terms.3. The right to change her mind.This belief is a doozy.  It is often seen being used in tandem with the first belief, namely, a woman "changes her mind" to "keep her options open."  Alternatively, it can also serve to shift the blame for a bad decision.  Women don't like to admit they made a mistake.  For example, you and a woman start dating, and she sleeps with you within the first week or so.  Upon further reflection, and after talking to one or more of her girlfriends, she decides that she slept with you too soon, and wants to "take things slow."  She believes that she has this right  what she gave you, she can take away -- without any repercussions.  Thereafter, she starts to focus very closely on how you treat her (i.e. romantically) to determine whether she made the right decision whether to sleep with you.  Obviously, if you don't measure up (and it is likely that you won't), she can blame you, claiming that you misled her and didn't turn out to be her Mr. Right.Your reaction to this behavior is to force her to stick to her decision, without making it apparent that you are doing so.  Do not, under any circumstances, indicate that you will tolerate her going back on her choice.  The minute she made a choice that involved you (i.e. got into a relationship, slept with you, etc...) it stopped being her choice to rescind.  Put another way, if she chose to get into a relationship with you, the attempt to change her mind will affect you (i.e. she will break your heart).  While you can't force her to continue loving you, she needs to understand that changing her mind carries with it certain penalties.  For example, you decide to buy a car, and pay whatever the dealer charges.  A few months later, you aren't "in love" with the car anymore, and want to return it and get your money back.  Will the dealer refund your money in full?  Absolutely not.  You made a choice to buy the car, and your decision to unload it will cost you a great deal of money.  The same goes for women.  If she breaks up with you, the "friend" part of the relationship goes as well  you will no longer be there for her (physically, emotionally, or for convenience).Ultimately, allowing a woman to "have her cake and eat it too" should not be tolerated.  She wouldn't tolerate it from you -- why should you tolerate it from her?------------------It could happen to you, just like it happened to me, there is simply no immunity, there's no guarantee...[This message has been edited by Sting (edited 05-12-2001).]

    The Law of Reality (Life Changing Stuff) 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Simply, if a woman likes you, she'll make it abundantly clear to you that she does!  Most of us know when a woman sees us as a friend or as a potential lover.  When a girl likes you, she gives off certain cues.  Work your DJ skills by touching her (kino), keeping her laughing, and getting the phone number or date close.It must be said here, that if a girl seems unwilling to give you her number or go out on a date, she's not really interested.  MOVE ON!As guys we're always giving women the benefit of the doubt, because most of us would never pass up, at least, an oppurtunity to get a free meal and have a night out with a fun person.  That's why we don't see how women can never seem to quite make up their minds (in reality they're saying no).  We rationalize it for them by saying "Oh she must really be busy," etc.  The Law of Reality (Doc Love calls it the Reality Factor) says if you like a person then you make it known to them!I've fallen victim many times to women's fickle ways.  It's as almost if, one minute they really like you and the next minute they're saying, well let's just be friends.  There is no better way I know, of making a woman make up her mind than to move on!  She will know that you are not the average needy chump, and that you have options.  As men we have catered to a woman's every need and want in hopes that they will reward us with sex!  We have even given up some of our self respect for this coveted goal...and for what I might ask?  To have her call us up on a Sunday night after Mr. Suave dumped her!  Hell no!Men of the world, I say get with the program, and make women realize that they must pursue you too!  Every good relationship is reciprocal.  If you call, she better call back or you will (now what's the phrase of the day class?)  That's right...MOVE ON!I hear guys say all the time, Mr. Suave she's acting really funny as of late.  What should I do?  MOVE ON!But Mr. Suave, we had a really nice date.  I called her and she hasn't called me back after 3 days!  MOVE ON!There's this really hot woman at work/school who keeps saying that she wants go go out but never seems to have any time!  You get the point.Guys, the moral of all this is that we hurt ourselves by trying to give women who are not attracted to us, a piece of ourselves (time, money, affection).  We've all been there.  These women string us along, never really devoting much of themselves back to us.  We see the signs and know that it's not working, but we give up reason in hopes that we'll get sex!  Which do you want in the long run?  Emotional well-being or baggage?There are great women out there.  Women who we truly wouldn't mind giving ourselves to, and who wouldn't mind giving themselves back to us.  Happy Hunting![This message has been edited by Rico (edited 05-11-2001).]

    ONS rules 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Rules you should follow for a one night stand.1. If you're lookin' to score, be prepared.  This means, in the trunk of your car is your overnight bag.  Toothbrush, toothpaste, cologne, gel, comb, condoms, chocolate body paint... you name it.  Oh yeah, and shave real close before going out.2. Pace your drink.  Do not get drunk.  You don't want to sacrafice your standards for a night with a sub-zero beast seen through the bottom of a 26 of vodka.  Stay sober enough to drive.3. Don't spend too long with a woman at the bar.  If they're interested in getting laid they'll let you know, subtly, or blatantly, but either way they'll be lookin to get out of there right away.4. Never take them back to your place.  Don't let them know where you live.  You don't know the woman, she might be a f*ckin' nutcase.5. They will go to the washroom at some point to wash their p*ssy.  Take this as your cue to ease off on the clothing.  Remember, when removing your clothes, socks first.6. Foreplay... know the zones.  Scalp, earlobes, neck, breasts, sacrum(bermuda triangle of love), p*ssy, inner thighs, back of the knee, and my favoraite, the achilles tendon, a great starting point.  Oh, and when you think you're done, add ten minutes.7. Sex... 3 different positions, 2 different rooms.  Should be wild and freaky sex.8. Do NOT cuddle afterwards... Instead, lie on your back and allow her to roll over and rest her head on your chest.  Do NOT thank her.  Simply breathe... 9. Wait until she's asleep to leave.  Write a little note and leave it on the kitchen table or on her night table.  Do NOT stay the night.  10.  Protect yourself.  Rubbers are not so much to protect the woman as to protect the guy.Deagleclaw out------------------No matter what comes, walk like a man.  - Al Lan Mandragoran (Wheel of Time)

Patience comes from confidence and is one of the five most important things in life, the rest of them I will let you know when I find out, have patience.Good, now that that is out of the way here are some thing things you need to know to ascend to True Don status. You must appeal to her power of seduction. Let her use her sensuality and sexuality to "catch" you. The important thing is that once you know a girl is interested in you, then you can appeal to her power of seduction by playing hard to get. Don't call her every night. Don't make big sexual moves on her at first. You must appear to be interested, yet still holding back a bit - not quite sure if you want the relationship to go further. Make her feel as though she has to work harder to convince you that you do want the relationship to develop.Remember, don't rush things sexually. Appear as if you are still deciding whether or not you want to be involved. A great way to accomplish this, is to end a date before she does. You've gone to a movie and are now having a bite to eat at a restaurant. Instead of letting the date drag on to that awkward time when she finally says she has to go home, maintain control of the evening. While the conversation is still good, while the date is still going well, announce that it's getting late and it's time to go. Tell her that you enjoyed the evening and that you are looking forward to getting together again Also, if the mood, the time, the place isn't right, or it feels the slightest bit awkward, don't try kissing her for the first time. If she's interested, the time and place will come. But, by pushing it, you risk blowing an important event, you risk coming off as being desperate for action and worst of all, you risk appearing inexperienced and inept. Don't be afraid to wait until the time is right.Remember the better looking the girl the more you have to this so If the girl is a 10. don't call her more than twice week if you just meet her(1-10 weeks), and even that is pushing it. Always give unique compliment and be cool and you'll be on your way to ascending to 'True Don' status.------------------Don Phenom-Known the best for breaking hearts and backbones

    Friendship zone or hell? What do you call it? 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


"The Worst That Can Happen" or, "A Portrait of the Chump as a Young Man" You meet a beautiful woman, you don't have the courage to make a move on her, but you become "friends". You spend the next several months (or years!) of your life obsessing about this woman, pining for her from a distance, never having the courage to even touch her hand. Occasionally, you'll get a friendly hug or a friendly peck on the cheek, and you will pathetically crave and need these displays of affection, which for her are nothing but friendly overtures, but for you are the tip of some *imaginary* iceberg of lust and sexual furor. You'll go home, lay on your bed, and jerk off three times a day while fantasizing about her. You watch her date other men, smiling and shaking their hand, patting them on the back, (because she's your FRIEND, after all). It's like a knife in the gut when they stick their tongue down her throat in front of you, and you can't even allow yourself to imagine them ****ing her because you might have to kill yourself. You won't be able to approach other women either because you've convinced yourself that you're supposed to be with this one woman, and it's better to be her "friend" than nothing at all to her. So you'll be alone, just you and your right hand, and the misery will build, the frustration will grow, until it is unbearable. You're rolling around on the floor crying, or bent over clutching your gut, saying "Why? Why? Why won't she love me?" and you decide you MUST do something. Anything! You agonize over it for days, going over every possible permutation of the conversation in your head. You can't sleep at night because you keep running through what you are going to say. Finally, over an otherwise totally innocent cup of coffee, you decide to broach the subject. You casually mention that you think the two of you would be better as a couple. Oh, you think you're being so suave and subtle, don't you? But she laughs, because she thinks you're joking, since to her it's so blatantly obvious the two of you could never be more than friends. This breaks your carefully constructed facade (because all of the scenarios you ran through in your twisted, obsessive mind never ended with her rejecting you; that wasn't even a possibility in your consideration). It puts you on the defensive -- you have to rebuild your little fantasy, so you start listing the reasons why you are right for each other and explaining how deeply you feel about her, not noticing the look of horror growing on her face as she realizes that the deepest thing about you is your set of deep-seated psychological problems. Directly as possible she puts you in your place and beats a hasty retreat outta there. You, of course, are crushed and hate yourself for being so stupid as to tell her how you really feel. Now you don't even have her as a friend, she's totally out of your life. So you immediately plan to regain her friendship...because "it's better to have her as a friend yadda yadda yadda." You call her or meet her, and totally lie and debase yourself. "Oh, silly me, it was just a crazy idea, I've been lonely, but I'm all over it now, I really couldn't bare to lose your friendship, blah blah blah." She, of course, accepts you back as a friend because she enjoys having you around to give her rides home and go to coffee or movies with between boyfriends. You, of course, are back to jerking off three times a day and living in misery. Somewhere in the distance, though, you can hear a voice. If you strain, you can make it out. . . listen . . . it's saying something to you . . .it's saying something. . . it's saying . . .. "Welcome, young sir. Welcome to Hell." THERE IS A SOLUTION!!!! The only way to fix this, is to go through the HORROR of getting to meet more girls.. IT will hurt and it will kill and it will make you feel so bad. But in the end you will have girls calling your house asking to hang with you and that cant be bad can it.   LOL And then you will look back and see just how incompetent you were when you were an average frustrated chump. The most noble and commendable thing an wuss can do is take action to change it. Just taking action in itself is a reward in itself. For an average person the change over shouldnt take longer than about 3 months. After which you will probably have already accumulated 5 or so girls. Which is about 5 more than what you would have had if you didnt go and try. Go out and approach 4 women every day! Thats only 4! You could EASILY do it in an hour! Yes, you will get rejected MANY times, yes you will be nervous and afraid, and yes you will overcome your fears and start seeing RESULTS!!! How many success stories have you guys seen on this board? Not many. Just a bunch of whiners who arent ready to commit themselves to becoming more succesfull with women. I challenge all of you to get your asses in gear and make a commitment to changing yourself and overcoming your fears!!!POSTED BY: Vassago (Oct 3rd 99)

    <h3>
    My 3 month plan for success w/ women 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Well it could take more than 3 mos but here it goes... First Month Take an inventory of all of your weak points. Be Ruthless. Write it all down. Then picture how you want to appear. Maybe it's more confident or smarter or tougher. Whatever. Again. Write it down.Next set realistic  goals as to how you are going to make those improvements over the next four weeks. Maybe talking to one girl a week, or going to the gym three times a week or whatever.  Every morning when you wake up review this list and think about what you are going to do that day to work towards these goals.HOWEVER>>>>>>DO NOT FOCUS ON ANY ONE WOMEN AT THIS TIME. You are not trying to date at all here! This is time for you to improve. Be Selfish!Second Month First of all look at your progress. You probably didn't meet all your goals, step up the ones you did and reaffirm those you didn't.Next thing is to get an interest, that is if you don't have one. I don't mean anything mundane like computer junk or baseball. Get an interest that people will identify you by. "That guy who welds sculptures" "The bowhunter" "The triathlete" Whatever.This is important for a multitude of reasons but mostly b/c 1) it shows you are passionate about something (why do you think women love musicians even if they're ugly?) and 2)it makes you stand out as someone who does his own thing, is confident and makes their own life interesting (ie. you'd do the same to hers)Still do not focus on any one woman. Keep it to research and practice. Third Month Evaluate your progress and up your goals again. Next trying to talk to any women at all. See if you can get to be friends with more women, from class, or work. This might go against common thought, but it actually does a few things for you. 1)gives you social proof (another girl is vouching for you)and expands the network of cool girls you meet with minimal effort. The friends of your friends turn into dating prospects or friends and it continues exponentially.Fianlly Come out of your Cocoon. You'll be happier, healthier and more confident and you'll have become much more attractive w/o worrying about eye contact and pick up lines.I guarante that this will work if you really try it for three months. It took me a lot longer than that and I'm still learning and improving but...its worth it.

    <h3>
    Forget About The Girls In Your Past 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


About a month ago, a female friend of almost 20 years and I decided to become more than friends...It took only less than 2 weeks before she stopped returning my calls.Now I'd expect that from a girl I just met, but this hurts more because this was someone I've known and loved as a friend for almost 20 years. We practically grew up out of the same cradle. She should have been confident enough in our friendship to let me know the truth without fear of a confrontation. It leaves me no choice but to re-evaluate our friendship. Thats the worst part of it.But after thinking about it, I no longer blame her for the situation. I blame myself 100%. My friend obviously has some self-esteem issues. Else she would have had the confidence to dump me face to face. But I blame myself anyway. I should have known better.I still consider her my friend and will treat her as such. Because this whole fiasco was my fault, not hers. I deserve what happened to me.Why do I blame myself? Because I've been on this site almost a year and made a bonehead rookie mistake. I thought that I could rekindle something that was never there: High Interest Level From A Woman In My Past.I made the classic mistake of thinking that I could turn a past disinterested woman, albeit a friend, into an interested woman. Anti-Dump once warned me about it in the post "The Return of the User Part I", but I slipped and did it again last month. (Feel free to run a search on that post.)Now I realize she only went along with my attempts at being more than friends (temporarily) so she wouldn't hurt my feelings.DJs, I implore you to learn from my bonehead mistake. Once you become a DJ, you must rule out ALL women from your past. That includes secret crushes, ex-girlfriends, female friends, etc. ANY WOMAN YOU HAD A FRIENDSHIP OR RELATIONSHIP WITH BEFORE FINDING THIS WEBSITE WILL MOST LIKELY NEVER BECOME YOUR GIRLFRIEND. GET THAT SILLY PIPE DREAM OUT YOUR HEAD ASAP!Yes there are exceptions, but it is very rare.I now understand that I made unfavorable first impressions on these women a long, long time ago and will never live it down. I will always be a weakling in their eyes and thats a cruel fact of life that I'll have to accept.The only limitation to the DJ principles is that they will only work on present and future women, not past ones. Bottom line...Forget about the girls in your past. Heaven knows I'm trying to.

    <h3>
    Never Ask To Become Exclusive 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Becoming exclusive with a     woman means the both of you   talk about not dating or seeing anyone else. The dating with others comes to   an end.Never ask a women to become   exclusive. She must ask YOU.  She must talk about it FIRST. Why? If a woman hasn't asked you yet it means she is still open to seeing others. She    still has DOUBTS about you.   Highly interested women don't want you going out with other women. A woman asking for            exclusivity is like a         'marriage proposal'. She is   cementing and laying the      foundation for true intimacy.She wants something that's lasting. It is the ULTIMATE   test of interest, guys. She is 'proposing'.If you ask first, you will never know her true interest  level. Why didn't she bring it up? How come she is still  letting you see others? Why   isn't she CLOSING her options? Is she seeing someone else? Think about it.AD

    Keep 'em guessing..  
    </h3>
    <p>
    


This is a simple techinique I've used a few times before with success. It breaks the ice easily and is a lot of fun for both of you. Whenever a girl asks you to give/tell her something.. ask her to guess something first before you MIGHT do the thing she wants. here's an example.I once met a girl who began to talk to me.. as we had chatted a while, she asked if I had some bubble gum with me.. I said "maybe", so she started to want it even more. When I told her I had bubble gum with me I told her she MIGHT have some after she guessed what's the make of the bubble gum. She kept guessing over and over again but didn't give me the rigth answer. She became anxious. She moved closer towards me and tried to search through my clothes for it. *Great opportunity for some KINO. She finally guessed it right.. and tought she MIGHT have some. Guess what I did? I put all what was left into my own mouth.. =) I gave her NOTHING. That was a good example, and good evidence that women in general want something they MIGHT have.that simple scenario broke the ice completely and made her "crazy"..You can keep 'em guessing anytime, anywhere.. I tried it at school as we got our report cards and some girls came to me and started to ask my grades. I didn't tell them anything, I only said "guess". They started guessing and for my surprise they seemed to love what they were doing.I'm sure this techinique is suitable for any situation.. after a woman said "do you love me?", has anyone of you said "guess" ?? -GP------------------"Live your life, that's what it's meant for." -me"Risks must be taken, because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing" -unknown[This message has been edited by guitar player (edited 07-30-2000).]

    Good advice! 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Hello all guys both younger and older......I'm quite new to this forum.....I just kind of stumbled across it but find it very interesting.......Some of the posts are really sad so I figured I'd chime in with a few "tips" of my own and maybe help some of you fellows out........I'm 44, happily married for 14 years, no affairs, but lord knows I could've had more than my share......I'm fairly good looking (got better looking with age) have put on a few extra lbs.  (Hell, who doesn't?) and have started sprouting a few gray hairs (makes me look distinguished!)........I'm here to tell you that I NEVER PICKED UP A WOMAN IN MY LIFE! They always picked me up, and they will you too, if you just follow some simple advice.......1. Make yourself as visually appealing as possible.......stay very clean.....have good teeth......if your teeth are bad, get 'em fixed.......if your fat, then lose the weight.......get a decent haircut and keep yourself groomed to the max.......if you wear glasses, then consider contacts......if you hate contacts then ask A GIRL that works at the eye place to help you pick what looks best on you......wear nice looking casual clothes.......go to the mall and find A GIRL working in the clothing store to help you select a wardrobe (they love doing this)2. Get off your ass and go to places where girls are WORKING......could be anywhere......store clerks, waitresses, tellers at banks......wherever......make sure they see you......then go back! Often! The more they see you the more they feel they can trust you (Face it, there are some real loonies out there) and the more they'll get interested........Forget about working up the courage to approach some babe you've never or will probably never see again....most people don't really care to hear from total strangers.......go for the ladies that WORK in these places, you are much more likely to see them again......3. If you see someone you'd like to get to know better, make sure she takes notice of you........keep it simple, just look at her and with a smile say "Hi"....then go on about your buisness.......be coy, glance at her again and see if she's sneaking looks at you.....if so, this is a good sign! When you leave, say "So long" cheerfully and plan on going back.......4. When you return sometime, take notice of her reaction to seeing you.......if she seems pleased to see you, then go to the next step...(NOTICE: Not all women will think you're very interesting, they'll think you're like a shrub, ok, but nothing to get excited about)5. Introduce yourself......Tell them; "It's never easy to introduce myself to strangers, especially when I find them as attractive as you, but may I try?" The rest is up to you......Sometimes they're not available, sometimes just not interested, but if you followed my earlier steps you really shouldn't have too much trouble knowing who is glad to see you and who couldn't care less......If you get turned away, take it with dignity and humor.....say "I had to try"......Don't let them insult or berate you.....If you hear "Get lost jerk" then say casually "I guess that rules out the ******* I was hoping to get"6. Learn how to kiss......women adore good kissers.....remember what I said about good teeth.......7. Watch James Bond flicks!!!! He is the master!!!8. Stop falling in love at first sight and being carried away....women detect this, it scares them and makes them think you're a creep!9. Make them laugh.......THE # 1 SIGN THAT A WOMAN LIKES YOU IS WHEN SHE LAUGHS AT THE THINGS YOU SAY!!!!! The woman you can make laugh will do anything for you....Women who never laugh should be avoided like pissed-off rattlesnakes.......10. Trust your instincts, if you think she likes you, she probably does........act as if she does, be confident, and the good ones will come around!Good luck!!!

    <h3>
    How I did it......... 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


In an earlier post someone asked me to give some tips; how I used to attract, approach......did I flirt?, did I use "Kino", etc.,.......During most of my twenties, I went out with probably close to eighty-odd different women. Some of them I banged, some I didn't. Some were very beautiful and intelligent, others were useful only to help clean my appartment. I never went out with anybody who couldn't laugh (at least not for long)....Availability was always a prime ingredient. I didn't really let them having a "boyfriend" put me off, but being married was a no-no.....I never wanted to deal with a pissed-off hubby! I did hit on an engaged chick once, she was tempted, but backed off......I advise not wasting time on engaged chicks.I'm a pretty nice looking man. I know it means alot when trying to attract women. Alot of you guys want to attract and meet gorgeous women but you may not look like such a prize yourself. No doubt there's a bit of a double standard at work here. Some guys actually believe that if they read the right book, or learn to say the right thing, that they can have their pick of great looking chicks, no mater what they, themselves, actually look like. Forget it. Good looking women are attracted to good looking men. You can be the funniest, coolest guy around, but if you have zero physical appeal then you better lower your standards. Bad teeth without a cheerful smile is probably the single biggest turn-off for most females. Get your teeth as white as possible, avoid bad breath and always keep your hands sparkling clean also. Women look long at a man's mouth and hands, if they notice something they don't like, you have a big strike against you.I usually went for "eye contact times two".....I'd notice a girl that looked good, make direct eye contact and smile. I wouldn't say "Hi" unless they were close by.....later, I'd look again, direct eye contact with a smile. If I got a smile back in return both times, I made my move. I'd walk up and say, "Hi, my name's Michael, what's yours?" When I got their name, I'd use it constantly, women think their name is the most important word in the world.It's pretty simple, really. I talked to them. Women love to gab and be listened to. Why do you think all those goofy talk shows have a mostly female audience?I'd ask, and then listen. "You come here often?", "Have you worked here long?", etc.,...it always worked like a charm. I'd occasionally get blown off....it never really bothered me. They didn't even know me, so who cared? I always figured they were just dumb and couldn't help it. You have to forgive stupidity. They just didn't know a good man when they saw one.I'd try to set up a date right then. It was more exciting. I'd get a phone # for confirmation. I'd call about a day before the date. If they acted wishy-washy, I dropped them immediately. I'd say, "Well, it's been nice talking to you, so long." Click. I had no patience whatsoever with the faint of heart. Many, many times, I got called back. But I always told them I had other plans. Looking back, I guess I was kinda cruel. I just never believed in kissing a woman's *ss.Keeping one was easy. I always had a "hands-off" policy until they touched me first. Once they started touching me, it was flood gates open. I never talked about sex. Didn't need to. They already knew what I wanted, but also knew I could be patient enough to wait for it.Once I started banging them, it was even easier. I always ravished every chick I ever made love to. I know they appreciated it. I used alot of massage. Marknola said (in words to this effect) that a woman who is having wonderful love being made to her figures that her lover must really love her. I don't think I ever really realized this, but I don't think I've ever heard anything more true. Very brilliant.That's about all I can say. I was never afraid or even nervous. Why be afraid of someone 5'6", 125 lbs.? If somebody that little scares you, you'd better grow some balls, quick time.Later guys>>>>BJB

    <h3>
    The power of observation 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Hello everyone......I haven't been here for awhile......figured I would check in and read some posts.....Looks like more than just a few guys are getting pretty frustrated with their efforts....very understandable, we've all been there at some time....Here's a couple things that I thought some of you might find interesting; some observations I made over the years during my "wolf" days......There is a big difference between being "desperate" and "impatient".....a desperate guy gives gifts, flowers, always offering to do favors, showering women with compliments, etc.,.....an impatient guy gets tired of the games, doesn't obsess, and always remembers that women are literally everywhere.....It's good to learn some patience with women, most of them operate at a more relaxed pace than we do. It's this fact that tends to frustrate alot of you guys because you're ready to nail her right now.......She, on the other hand, is wanting to take things much slower, if for no other reason than to test your true desires. They want to bang you just as bad as you want to bang them, they just want to get to know you a little better before they take the plunge.But some chicks like fast action, and knowing who they are and where you can find them can sometimes get you banging them alot quicker.Slow, patient chicks: Bookstores,Churches, coffeeshops,libraries, clothes stores, museums, parks (if they're sitting alot) Nightclubs (if they're not dancing to fast music)......Girls that frequent these places alot usually like to take things slow, they don't like to be rushed, and in general will be turned off by a guy that comes on strong.......they really enjoy long conversations and appreciate patience.Fast, action chicks: Hockey games, drag races, stock car races, boxing matches, workout gyms and aerobics classes.....women that are into this stuff are more energetic and like to see a quick resolution to things, in general, they don't like waiting and will be put-off by a guy who screws around waiting for the perfect moment to approach them.During my younger days I spent many nights going to local stock-car races looking for hot girls. Many, many times, I'd meet one, watch a few races with her, and then end up in the back seat of my car with her later that same night. The kind of chick I'd marry? No way! But it sure was good, quick fun!Try doing some observing of your own. It can be really interesting. If you go to a laundromat and see a looker there, watch for how she spends her time waiting for the cycles to finish. Does she sit for long periods reading a book or mag? If so, she's probably the slower type. Does she get up and pace, looking out the windows, going out for a smoke, or drum her fingers on the machine? This is a woman that likes faster action and resolution.You can do the same thing at a grocery store.....does she look at every item carefully; checking prices and bargain shopping? Then she's slower and more deliberate. Does she walk fast, grabbing things quickly and just tossing stuff in her cart? This is a lady that doesn't like to wait. Start observing, then act accordingly.....it always worked for me!Go get 'em guys!!!>>>BJB

    <h3>
    Scaring women 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


This post relates to an experience while at university.  I lived on campus for two years.  Now, a lot of people did quite well for themselves while living on campus, whereas some did not, unfortunately, I fit into the latter category.  This story confirms some of the things I have read here.I have always been a pretty nice guy, and as you know, nice guys don't get women.  I have always been social, had a lot of friends, etc. but also been reserved, especially around women.  While I was living at college, it was the same old deal.  I was mates with most of the guys there that I felt were worth being friends with (our 'dorm' - in Australia it is a slightly different system to the US - had around 330 people).  I was also friends with a smaller group of women, but not as close to them.  And then I had a group of my best friend with whom I always hung out.  Anyway, I was always friendly and sociable, but I didn't initiate a lot of interaction with new people, it was usually started by them.Now one night, near the end of my second year, there was a large party.  At this party, one of the girls from the dorm came and started talking to me.  I don't like to be unkind, but basically she is one of the last women I would have chosen to talk to, but she did give me some valuable insight.  It turns out we have a mutual friend.  This friend had told her that I was actually a good bloke.  This is where the story gets more interesting.It turns out that this girl and her friends had previously had a nickname for me.  The 'axe-murderer.'  What had I ever done to deserve such a cognomen?  In my mind at that time, I had done nothing.  If you asked my friends, I was one of the nicest guys they knew.However, upon reflection, I know more.  Granted, I had a goatee and very short hair (shaved with #3 clippers) and do have a face that can look a bit threatening at times.  However, I didn't dress in anything to suggest this attitude, I didn't have tattoos or any piercings and I was a friendly guy.But I didn't smile at them, I probably didn't smile enough in general.  I didn't make small talk with them.  I didn't walk up to them at parties and introduce myself.  In general, I stuck to the friends I had and didn't make it obvious to strangers that I was a nice guy.  So what happened? I still had other guys initiate conversations with me, but not many women.  I know that these women in particular were afraid of me, and possibly so were others.So, I guess the point that I am trying to make is:People don't know you the way you know yourself, your appearance and actions speak volumes.  I thought at times that I was just taking it easy, being friendly and cool.  These women found me threatening and referred to me as the axe-murderer.  I can assure you that I am not axe-murderer material.  I just wasn't outwardly displaying my good mood or friendly intentions.  Do as so much advice tells you, smile.Oh, and furthermore, take advantage of your time at college!

    <h3>
    What I've learned so far. 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


    I've been reading this board for a few months, now.  I also ordered Doc Loves' "System" a few weeks ago.  Until I found the advice offered by Doc Love and the great guys (and girls) on this board, I was clueless.  I've learned a lot.   1. You need to have the right attitude!      -This is made up mostly of confidence.        You can gain so much confidence just        by reading this board.  With the        knowledge gained, you'll have more       confidence that you'll do the right       things in your relationships, and your        approach to women.      -For you shy guys (I'm a recovering shy       guy myself) You have to find the        motivation to stop yourself from being       shy.  I've found JamesBonds' posts a        big help in this area.       Nobody has to be shy.  You choose to        be shy.  Don't let fear stop you        anymore!  You have to realize that you       WILL make mistakes.  You WILL fail        more than you succeed.  You WILL get        rejected a lot, at first.  This WILL        hurt, and it won't happen overnight.       But, in the end you'll find the pain       of getting over your shyness is        sweeter than some of the relationships       you'll be having.       You have to work hard to get over        shyness.  No one can do it for you.        But, you can do it!  The work you do       will build character and confidence.       It will make you a better man, and        give you a better life.    2.You need to have patience and self-control if you're looking for a LTR.      -If you come on too strong or too fast       you'll scare her off.  Or, worse,        you'll be seen as weak and desperate.      -Don't rush things.  She sets the pace       in the relationship.  Let her initiate       touching.  Don't rush for a kiss or        commitment too soon.  Wait at least a        few days to call her early on.        (preferably 5 to 9)      - Don't fall for her too much, too        soon.  If you do, at least don't let       her know it.  Always make her wonder        where she stands with you.  Remember:       Be a Challenge.  If she really likes        you, she wants to chase you.  She        likes mystery.  She likes to feel       that she has to work to beat the com-       petition to win you over.  Why spoil       her fun?       -Remember: You're the prize she has to        win.  List all of the good things        about yourself.  Keep adding to the       list everyday.  Watch you confidence       grow as the list grows.  You'll soon        see why you're a good catch for any       woman.3. Don't be a wimp.      -Don't be afraid to stand up to her and       say no from time to time.  Don't say        it all the time, just let her know you       will stand up to her.  Let her know if       she does something you don't like.  If       you're going to keep her, you're going       to have to keep her respect.4. Don't ignore red flags and signs that she's really not interested in you.      -In case you haven't noticed, she's       often testing you.  How many guys       test women?  We often overlook        serious character flaws and lack of       integrity in a woman, because we can't       get past physical beauty and lust for       sex.  That's fine if all you want is       a one night stand.  But, if you want a       LTR, you better pay close attention to        her every word and deed.  This will       save you a lot of time, and heartache.       -It also helps to learn the signs of         her having a low interest level in         you.  (I know this from plenty of        recent experience.)  It'll keep you        from wasting more time and money,         than you should.  And, it'll keep you         from looking and feeling like an         idiot.Keep reading this board and working on improving yourself.  Then, when you finally find your Mrs. Don Juan, you'll both be glad you did.   Most of all, have fun with all of this.  Life is short, enjoy every day of it.

No guys this isn't another'Look at me, I'm so hot I bag all kinds of ass why are you all such pussies' post. I think there are already more of those here than needed but thats just me.I'm more like most of you reading the tips section. I'm just taking my first steps into the world of becomming a ladykiller. It's only been in the last couple of months that I started coming here and using all the tips and talking to girls and stuff. I'm not thin, I'm not pretty. I have a crummy job and after my breakup a couple of years ago I had to move back in with my mom so I could have the money I need to go to school full time and pay the (outrageous) child-support I have to pay every month.Not the greatest dating material right? Well to top it all off I have been a chronic niceguy for my whole life. SO when I decided on that fateful day that enough was enough. After I had just gotten burned by a stupid girl who had nothnig better to do than try to humiliate my even more I expected it to be tough. I expected rejection, humiliation, frustration, lack of success. But damnit I pictured that sorry little *****e's face and the way she had played me the fool and how that felt, and I saw red. I saw that no matter what I was going to have to go through, no matter how many times I got led on, shot down, ignored, ridiculed ect.. that by god I was going to show that ho, and everyone else, and myself... that I AM BETTER THAN THAT! SO I started, with my heart pounding and a lump in my throat, to talk to women. At first I was only talking, I never asked them out. I found this site and started reading. I read and read and read. I decided that a new wardrobe would help and I bougth some nice cologne. and I started asking for numbers. I knew the whole time of course that I was going to get throughtly trounced and prolly only get 1 number for every 20 or 30 girls I asked. I would never ask a girl if anyone else was around. I didnt want other people to see my pathetic effort and the denial that would surely come from it.But you know what? It wasn't that bad. when I finally got up the nerve and started asking sur there were times I got turned down. but more often than not I DIDN'T get turned down. And when I did it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. now, a couple of months into it, the approach doesnt worry me that much.  Beleive me, the REAL challenge starts after you get teh number. Rigth now I'm still in a big learning curve there (meaning I don't do so hot!) but if I could learn the approach, i can learn the rest. So all you fence-sitters out there, I hope you decide to stand up, get off the fence and start playing the game. Use the tips here on this forum and you wont go wrong. Take it from a guy like you...It's really not that bad!

    An example of the possible benifits in store from being a challenge 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Ok this is my first post of tips. I will keep the tips within the realm or things that I have personally experienced so that they are guaranteed to have some practical value( not that nothing in this forum doesn't because most of it does). I will post one thing at a time so as not to make a huge post nobody will read due to lack of attention span.1. last new years this girl (about an 8 to me) I was kind of into showed up to the same bar I was at. Anyways I hadn't seen her in awhile because she was away for christmas. So I went up to her and asked her how her christmas was and made small talk and acted like I was genuinely interested in her. I got some slight signs she was interested in me (smiles, kino etc). However it wasn't quite the amount of interest I wanted so using the principle of being mysterious and a challenge I just said well it was nice taling to you and went and played pool (ignoring her the whole time).  She kept trying to get my attention then she went away and started flirting with some ohter guys right by me. I paid no attention to her. When midnight hit she came out of nowhere and started kissing me. However I bet that if I had have went into some sort of jealous mindset and tried to get her attention while she was flirting with the other guys this wouldn't have happened. So to make a long story short always stick to your game because sometimes the girsl will try and use DJ tactics against you. you just have to stick to your guns. By the way I could have taken her home but I didn't because I got really drunk(I know bad excuse<stupid thing to do when trying to PU> ) and pretty much forgot all about her.

    Technique that worked to share with DJers.

Fellow DJs:I went on the prowl and was having little or no luck when I decided to visit the local video rental store on Sunday nite.  I had no intention of renting a movie but instead, landing a phone number.  I strolled the store and found an attractive woman looking at a movie which this Don Juan just happened to have seen.  So I simply said, "Good movie, I saw it on TV."  The movie was "61" which is about baseball.  That's all it took.  Small-talk ensued about baseball, the Mariners (I live in WA state), etc, etc.  I then told her "Well, I'll let you go so you can pick out your movie, but I've enjoyed talking to you.  Would you like to get together sometime and is there a number I can reach you?"  She replied, "sure."  We exchanged numbers and I was on my way.  Guys, this is getting easier and confidence is building.  I just wanted to share it with my fellow DJ'ers.

    The MOST Important Thing!

I know this will probably be moved-over to "TIPS" but I wanted you all to see this, so it goes...On this site, it's been said on numerous occasions, that "KINO" is a good technique to use on women. Well, I'm here to testify that KINO may very well be THE most important tool a dj has!I have been experimenting with it more often than ever lately, and I have noticed time and again that a convo with a girl that is going o.k. quickly turns into a hot flirtation when I introduce KINO into it!Try it! Put my theory to the test!The next time you have the opportunity to have a convo with a "bonnie lass", subtly touch her now and then, also give her a lingering hug. If she ever holds-out her hand to shake yours, make sure that when you take her hand, you hold on a little extra while smiling and looking into her eyes, and thinking to yourself "I can make love to you like you've NEVER been loved before!"If you need more KINO ideas, do a seach on KINO in this site.KINO guys, it will change your life!Now repeat after me, "I WILL do KINO on every cute girl I meet from now on"~Andy------------------"Before you sign a new act, find out if they are wack!"

    Quick Pick
    </h3>
    <p>
    


These are all tried and true examples of times when me or someone I was with picked up a chick.  These are just some examples of some of the situations.  Basically I usually start with a smile and a hi, unless I noticed something different on them or whatever.This was a pick-up at the movies in the lobby last Friday night.  We were walking past each other when...Me: Hey lady, how are you.Her: Fine, how are you.Me: I'm doing fine myself, what movie are about to go see.Her: bla, bla, bla, Me: That's a good movie, I'm bout to go see (insert movie here)Me: So what's up, you here by yourself or what.Her: I'm here with a few friends of mine.  We just hangin' bout to check out this new movie, what about youMe: Same here, just chillin' doin' the same, Oh what's your name by the way.Her: I thought you would never ask, my names Angela, what's your's.Me:"Stuart"Me: Anywayz, my movie is about to start in a few so I'ma head on out but give me your phone number so we can continue this.Her: I thought you'd never ask me that either, it's 555-5555.This pick-up happened after me and my homeboy finished playing basketball at a high school gym.  He was driving his Range Rover, I was on the passenger side chillin' when some chick was walking to school in the hot sun sooo...Him: Say girlHer: Hey (unentuhsiastic the whole time)Him: where you headedHer: To the school down the street (where we were coming from)Him: Well, do you need a rideHer: No I'm OKHim: You sure, it's kinda hot out here, I can just drop you...Her   interrupts) I don't take rides from strangersHim: It's all good, so what school do you go toHer: U of HHim: I do too, (small talk about the school for about a minute or so)Him: whats your name anywayHer:FeliciaHim:   Do you want to know mineHer: What is it.Him: BrianSmall talkHim: I'ma let you go but whats your phone numberHer: (she gives it)Him: Do you wanna know my number.Her: what is it.Him: (he gives it)She was calling him everyday after about a week or so just jocking. She eevn went to his dorm with some pajamas one time.This is a situation where I got this girls number in a gym, like at the basketball court.  I seen her a couple of times in work out gear but she was dressed all sexy this time so I go up to her and.....Me: Say girl, where you coming from all dressed up for.Her: I just came from schoolMe: For real, cuz I usually see you in work out clothes but you dressed all fly today like you just came from the club or something.Her: Whatever, I see you got some game though (talking about my basketball skills)Me: Well, I do what I can. I play ball for my school. What school you go to.Small talk.her: Well Im gonna chill out with my friends when I get home tonight though Me: Well why dont you let me chill out with you sometime.Her: How you gonna do that, you ain't even got my numberMe: Well, I was just gettin' to that.Here's a pick up in a mall, this is the hardest situation for me since girls get all shiesty with the looks and stuff,  My boy got like 10 numbers this day after he told me he would get 10 numbers, here's one situation where he got this chick, First he ran into her on purpose. She was looking all lost anywayHim: Damn girl watch where you goin'Her: Oh Im sorry.Him: Its alright, let me holla at ya for a second though (thats what he said)Her: Yeah whats upHim: what brings you to the mall today anyway.Her: Just shopping for some new clothes bla, bla, blaHim: For any special occasionHer: bla, bla, bla, school.Him: What school do you go to.Her: bla, bla, blaHim: Well give me your number so we can continue this little conversation on the phoneHer: Ok, it's 555-5555Him: aight then girl, I'ma call you up, but do what ya do and quit running into folks.her   laughs)Another situation in the mall where he got this chick when she was working.Him: Say girl can I talk to you for a secondHer: Well, let me finish with these customersHim: (after she's done)I see you looking fly in that little outfit you got on.Her:thanksHim: Well when are your off days anywayHer: I work only on the weekendsHim: You in school during the weekher: Yeah, I go to U of H.Him: Well I see you got customers waiting but give me your phone number and i'll give you a call on one of your offdaysHer: Ok.Me, on the first day of school.Me: How you doing.Her: Fine, how are youMe: Good, these classes are gettin' to me thoughHer: I know, I already got homework on the first dayMe: (small talk, like where ya from, what year are you, did you have a good summer)Me: Since I'm trying to meet someone new everyday at school, let me start off with you and get your phone number.Her: Sure, it's 555-5555.Me: Well, Ima let you go, i gotta get to class but it ws nice talking to ya.Pick up at wal-mart. I'm reading a magazine at the stand where this girl in work out gear is also readingMe: Say girl, you dress like that everywhere you go.Her: No I just finished working out.Me: On a Saturday night, I'm surprised you ain't out clubbin' or at a party like everyone else.Her: I'm takin' a break, i'm getting ready for school and we got cheerleading practice on MondayMe: (Big smile on my face)What, you a cheerleader, hold on a second (I put the magazine up and start chatting with her, saying stuff like can you teach me to be more flexible and stuff like that)I got her number after talking for like 10 minutes, some good flirting goin' on.Pick up at a car wash.  My homeboy went to wash his car and he was waiting for this sexy a$$ girl to finish washing her car, so I was like I'ma go talk to her, he was like go ahead (he's a straight pimp)so we were washing our car and I think he was waiting for me to talk to her cuz he kept looking at me until he took the iniative.  He told me to drive his car into the other car wash since she was taking so long.  Right when I got in his car and drove it,he went up to her and started talking to her, That $hit pissed me off but I couldn't blame him cuz I took to dang long to make a move but I heard what was going on and he was like.Him: What's up girl, thats a nice little ride you got thereher: ThanksHim: You from around here.Her: yeah, I go to Baylor UniversityHim: Yeah, me too, I stay at the plaza, where do you stay.small talkHim: Everybody must be treating you nice huh.Her: yeah, i don't know too many people, the only person I know really well is J.B. do you know him(some dude that he knew but acted like he didn't)Him: J.B. naw, I don't know no J.B.( he knew him)I don't remember the rest but he got her number cuz he showed it to me,  but I laughed at him when he told me he called her and it was her boyfriends number she picked it up and gave him the real number but he didn't call that chickenhead.  I was mad at first but I learned from my mistake...you snooze, you lose.  Anyway, I hope some of these examples help, I got a whole $hitload of situations where I got numbers but my hands afe too tired to type, but I'll type some more later, I just got this chick at Target today, it was a good approach cuz my homeboy was with me  here it is.Me: (when my boy is buying some candy)Hey girl, whats up with your manager being all sheisty with the jobs.Her: what you talking about.Me:Ok theres a line here and 14 aisles  open but there are only 2 being used and yo manager talking about he aint hiring.  It looks like you need some help though.(my boy laughing in the background)Her smiles)they should be hiring cuz I got this job pretty easy but they do need help, they always asking me to work these hours I don't wanna workMe: You in school or what (that "school" line works wonders for opening up a convo)Her: I go to Taylor, what about you, Me:girl I'm in college, I'm a grown a$$ man. Her: Well just cuz Im in HS don' mean I aint grownMe: You ain't mature enough (flirt for a minute or so)Me: When are your day soffHer: Tuesday, Friday, and I get off early on SaturdayMe: Well, let me hit you up on one of your days off, whats your number.I get that too.We got that southside slang in Houston, so you might have to change the words up a little to fit your style.  I'm out. [This message has been edited by StuartScott (edited 09-20-2001).][This message has been edited by StuartScott (edited 09-20-2001).]

    <h3>
    A lesson for the clueless ones 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Listen guys i'm going to share a story with you guys, hopefully you all will benefit from it.Last year i was just getting in from the bars at college and this chick comes up to me and starts making out with me.  Needless to say i spent the night with her.  We started to hang out a lot and that's when the mind games started.  Lesson #1 never get sucked in by a chic.  I made the mistake b/c i had never before met a chic this upfront.  A girl showed me this much attention, she's the one...right.....WRONG!!!!I was like a little whipped dog.  She never called me or stopped by, i was the one doing all the work.  I spent the night with her, she gave me a "happy ending" and thats basically the relationship.  She was messing with my head the whole time(i did everything she said, i tried to change for her), but once again;  this girl showed me attention, she's the one for me right.....WRONGTo make a long story short.  I was buying her things, saying lets hang out..etc. and i got burnt.  I was way above this girls league.  I couldn't even achieve an orgasm when we slept together(this was a clue right).  ONce again i was so drawn in by the fact that she initiated this whole relationship, that i was totally out of my mind.  Come on it's not everyday a girl shows interest...is it!IN conclusion, i found out that she was 2-timeing me with the ugliest most filthy guy in the world.  A college student who was about 5'9, 150, with homemade tattoos, and a drug habbit(he treated her like complete **** and she worshipped him). I was 100 times better looking then him in all attributes (body, mind, looks, etc) Needless to say i got burnt and guess who she dates this year.  I shouldn't care but this bit$h messed with my head so much, i actually became obsessed.  DON'T EVER EVER FALL THIS HARD, AND CHANGE YOUR WAYS FOR A CHIC!My advice to you, don't be an idiot like me.  Listen to your heart, mind, and dik.  Don't fall for a girl you'd never ever approach in a million years, just b/c she confronts you and falls at your heals.  Get to know her and be in control.I hope you guys learn from my stupid idiotic mistake.Take care, Tristan

    <h3>
    This conversation stuff really works! 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Experience for me, advice for you.The story goes like this: I went out tonight with a few of my female friends (it's great to have female friends, by the way) and they brought along a friend of theirs who I had only met one time before.  I didn't have a great amount of interest in this girl, but I decided that she would be great for practicing my DJ skills on.  I didn't realize how powerful this material can be.On the way back home, I started talking to her with the serious intent of refining my skills.  As is advised on this board, she was the subject of the conversation, and when the topics moved away from her, I tried to find a way to at least relate them to her, if not move her back to being the main subject.  I don't remember how we started talking, but once we did, I couldn't stop.  Maybe I've learned a lot, or maybe I was too focused on practicing, but the result was remarkable.  In about 20 minutes, she went from showing no interest in me to giving signals like it was her job.So there are two lessons here.  First, when it comes to talking to girls, talk to them about them.  It's actually quite easy, because most of the time, they can't shut up about themselves.  The second lesson is to practice.  Even if you find a girl you're not interested in, as I did tonight, practice talking to her.  Reading the posts here is great, but it's even better when you put when you learn into action.------------------"Women aren't supposed to make sense.  If they did, they'd be men."

    <h3>
    Death of an AFC 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


I was out in a town near me yesterday, sitting in one of my favourite cafes trying to eat and read. This town is a college town - lots of young, bright people. Sometimes they sit in this cafe and try and study. Or they do dates and stuff. Anyway - five minutes after I get there these two turn up. One of them is an Italian girl, around 20-ish. The other an Asian-looking guy, same age. She was around a 7.5. He was - well, dunno, cos I'm not good at rating guys, but he looked smooth and sharp, in a DJ kind of way. But a DJ he was not. It was *so bad* watching this guy set himself up. First off he's obviously interested, and that's why he's asked her out. But...The chick starts telling him that she has a lot of guy friends, and doesn't date any of them. And they all seem to want more from her. And - like - what's up with that? Can't people just be friends?And he says that yeah, some people just aren't emotionally mature enough to deal with that. (Implying - unlike him of course. Ha.)Then she launches into this long story about how she went out a few times with some guy over the summer, but it was just like, social. And then this guy started being really mean with her because he thought they were dating or something, and it was really upsetting and he implied she was a lesbian when she went out (get this...) as the only girl among a huge group of guys. And ended up being the only girl in a club that night.(So no attention seeing behaviour there, right?)*Then* she has this long monologue about how depressed she gets sometimes, and she just wants to be on her own and not answer the phone just in case she starts crying down it. And AFC guy is nodding and making *totally* sympathetic and understanding noises. And then they leave and he says 'So, let's do this again sometime.' And she agrees. Meanwhile I'd been trying to ignore all this, but this place is too small to hide in. And besides, it was like watching a major traffic disaster in slow motion. By the time they'd gone I was thinking 'Say - huh?' in a speechless kind of way. Let's just recap, for the benefit of our viewers at home:Chick doesn't value her female friendsChick has many male friends, a lot of whom want her, but she doesn't want themChick gets into weird scenes and doesn't know whyChick gets clinically depressedAnd so we see why AFCs get it so very, very wrong. Just because this chick was a 7.5 doesn't make her good dating material. But AFC guy - unlike a real DJ - was totally unable to see past the smooth skin and the pretty arched eyebrows and the breathy, sexy foreign accent to realise that not only is he very, very unlikely to ever sleep with this chick, but even if he did she'd be high maintenance and pretty much guaranteed bad news. Is there a moral? How about this - *DJs know not all girls are worth dating* If you're new to the game you might be thinking 'Yay - way to go! I got this hottie to go out with me!' And yes, that is indeed a success, especially if you've done it the hard way, closed on the digits, and all of that. But wait - there's more to think about. If you can't read the signs, *even if a chick seems keen* she could still be very bad news. And being a 7.5 or a 9 or whatever has *nothing to do with that.* There's this idea that getting a date is a sign of high interest. No! A chick may go on a date with you because she's bored or because she needs an emotional tampon or for whatever other dumb-ass reason she needs to suck your energy. What you really want is a chick that's interested but also seems to have her life together. So if you get a rejection from a chick - well, maybe you just got lucky, and missed out on a real psycho-loser. And if you get interest, listen - for God's sake, listen - to what she's telling you. Because if you don't you'll end up pointlessly chasing her tail like AFC guy was about to find out. And you *so* do not want to do that.

    <h3>
    BIG, important tip... 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


The power and influence that a girls closest friends have to influence her decisions should NEVER be underestimated. (I am going to use the hypothetical hottie "Judy" to make this tip easier to understand.)If you can get Judy's friends on your side you will find that they will work in your favor. It's like having someone working behind the scenes for you. Her friends will actually ENCOURAGE her to pursue you and/or (hopefully) hook up with you even when you aren't around. If, for some reason, Judy's closest friends come to dislike you then this concept works in the opposite direction. They will try to get her to hook up with someone else (that they do like) and they will talk bad about you and make fun of you when you aren't around. I learned the importance of this concept many years ago and have been sure to use a girl's friends to my advantage ever since. I can also look back and see relationships with girlfriends that went sour right around the same time that I started not getting along with her friends. Some tips on getting in good with the friends...  - Don't ignore the friend. I don't like to be ignored, you don't like to be ignored. In fact, most likely they are sick of being ignored. You are hitting on their (probably) better looking friend who is always getting all the attention. Give her some attention and she will love you for it.  - Treat both of them with respect. Judy's friend is watching you like a hawk while you talk to her. One little peek at her boobs when you THINK that nobody is watching and when you walk away Judy's friend is whispering in her ear, "That guy is such a jerk, he was staring down your shirt! LOSER!"  - Become friends with the friends. This is especially important if you are planning on pursuing a LTR with a girl. Now, if Judy leaves you her friends will be like We miss _________. And make her feel guilty for dumping you. ; ) This is always difficult to do (sometimes a girls friends are pretty annoying) but it pays off big in the long run if you can not only be nice to the friends but if you can actually BEFRIEND them. To summarize, become friends with the Judy's friends, and they will talk about how good looking you are. Piss her friends off and they will talk about how good looking someone else is.Hope this helps,Brian Gladu

    <h3>
    an excellent tactic 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Hey guys,Although women say they go to bars to dance, we all know that's bull****. Women go to bars to have their egos stroked, get free drinks, and have fun, and meet lots of guys they can talk about for hours with all their friends.So the main thing is in your approach you want to convey 2 things from your appearance. 1) You're not just some guy, you're somebody important, cool, and confident. 2) You don't have an agenda, you just would like to meet her... Okay, your approach must be direct but casual as well. No opening cheese line. Simply walk up and say "Hi, my name's _____, I haven't seen you here before." If she's receptive to your advance she'll tell you her name. This opening sets you up for a lead into a casual conversation about where she likes to go out, what she likes to do. Keep the conversation focused on what she likes. Mirror her actions, and words, stay for about 5 or 6 minutes. Then when a pause in conversation arises...<don't let the pause last for more than 5 seconds> say, "You know I'd really like to stay and chat with you for a bit but I'm afraid I have to disappear for a while. Maybe I'll run into you later for a dance. It was a pleasure meeting you <her name>." Remember her name for later. Now go find some random girls, you're not really interested in, to dance with for a bit. Don't TRY to be noticed by the girl you were talking to, but don't hide either. If it comes up later, say that you had to get up because you just remembered you had promised a dance to someone. Come back a little later and talk some more and get her phone number.If she didn't give you her name right off the bat it means she is not interested... at the moment, and that you either need to work some more or piss off. To reverse her position, she needs a neg hit. Simply say that you came over to find out a bit about one of her friends that she's with. Pick one less attractive than her. Ask a few questions about her under the guise of trying to determine whether her friend has the credentials you're looking for. If she asks why you don't just go talk to her yourself, say that you find friends are more honest in these sort of surroundings and you'd rather not waste your time. The affrontery of it all! The woman you're really interested in will be FUMING that you're not interested in her and will try to get you to cave in and tell her she's more attractive than her friend. As you elicit more info about her friend, feign a little disinterest in certain points about her friend. "She likes Babylon 5???" or something of the like. Whether you like it or not, you are trying to convey that you probably wouldn't connect with her friend without actually saying it.The woman you're interested in will jump on your bandwagon and try to make herself look like a better catch and concur with you on these, which is when you say "Yeah, thanks for givin' me the low down. I'm not so interested as I was... You know, at first when I approached you I thought you were pretty stand offish, You shouldn't grimace when people introduce themselves to you. I think WE could have hit it off quite nicely, except for that. Enjoy your night." Don't ask for her number. She'll find the opportunity to bump into you later after she works out in her head what a mistake she just made letting you out of her sight. Women have the amazing ability to escalate a minor little annoyance to DEFCON 4. She will make it a priority that night to find you and get you to ask for her phone number.Deagleclaw out------------------No matter what comes, walk like a man.  - Al Lan Mandragoran (Wheel of Time)

    <h3>
    WAKE UP you AFC'S (part II) 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


WORKING SHORT-TERM AND THINKING LONG-TERMI know this is long, but all you AFCs should print it out and read it, TWICE.Ok, listen up. If youre not happy with WHO YOU ARE at the moment. If you dont thinking meeting ONE GIRL every THREE MONTHS is very impressive. If you want to be able to chat to that girl in the MOVIE LINE, ask the cashier out on a DATE or chat up the girl at the CLUB but you feel all of these things just arent you, then YOU NEED TO CHANGE. Let me teach you what Ive learnt this year.Im not going to pretend doing any of the above things come easy to me. They dont. Not ALL of them. Not YET. But talking to women, flirting with women, going to night clubs and actually having GIRLS INTERESTED IN ME wasnt quite me a year ago.In high school I was a nerd, the girls thought I was a walk-over. I was extremely quiet, I got bullied, I didnt stand up for myself. I got nervous just trying to say Hi to a girl, I didnt really talk to anyone. I played Quake till midnight most weekends and had never been drunk, gone to a club or done anything most normal high school students do. What changed? My attitude. I started University this year, and I really WANTED to change. I started forcing myself into situations which would normally make me uncomfortable (talking to girls, participating in class discussions, etc) until they became a habit. Ive changed a lot, in only a year. I dont have a girlfriend to show for it. But Ive met more girls than Ive ever met in my WHOLE LIFE and spoken to them all A LOT. Ive learned a lot about girls I didnt know before. Admittedly being in a place where there are girls EVERY WHERE makes practice a whole lot easier, but I still had to challenge my fears. I met a great girl at the end of the year, I approached her, flirted with her AND conversed with her. All these things I would have never thought possible a year ago. I know she liked me, unfortunately it was badly timed  just before exams, a few weeks before end of year, and she is currently with someone, seeing as shes a decent chick shes not about to dump her BF for someone shes just met.Shes the best girl I met the whole year. She could be the girl that Bob gets told about in my last post (Wake up you AFC part I). I wish I were Bob, 8 months ago. I would have done a lot of things differently, I would have taken a lot more chances coming up to the day I met her, and I would have made sure I was the ideal catch by the time I met her. Also, I would have JUMPED on any opportunity to meet her sooner (rather than assume Ive got all the time in the world.)  But maybe it wasnt her, maybe theres another lady a month from now?What if I told you that you ARE BOB, even if youve just broken up with your girlfriend, or just got rejected by your latest love interest? I believe that at ANY time in our lives, we ARE BOB, but no one can tell us about the girl were going to meet in 8/9/however many months. Even though I lost out on the girl I spoke about, Im still in Bobs position and I AM going to meet another WONDERFUL girl in the FUTURE. I dont know when. But I want to BE READY when that girl comes around. You probably feel that you want to IMPROVE yourself, that you want to date beautiful women, and be more confident. In order to do this, you have to stop thinking about what you WANT in the SHORT-TERM and starting FOCUSING on what you WANT in the LONG-TERM.Work hard in the SHORT-TERM, to get what you WANT in the LONG-TERM.  (Pump iron now, for the BIG MUSCLES later on).Stop thinking about what you want NOW (that HOTTIE sitting over at the bar) and start THINKING about WHAT YOU WANT IN THE FUTURE (the girl youre GOING to meet at the bar when youre a STUD in 8 months time).You have to study hard every day (short-term) even if you dont enjoy it, so you can achieve your long-term goal of passing the EXAM and eventually getting a great CAREER.So, dont worry about getting a girl friend RIGHT NOW (everyone here has said that a THOUSAND times), work on improving yourself so that you can have a girlfriend in the FUTURE.I want you to do this for me (Im going to do it for myself): See every girl you meet (until you finally hit the BULLS-EYE) as PRACTICE. Stop worrying about every girl you meet, what she thinks of you, etc. Just focus on improving yourself NOW so that youre what you (and your future girlfriend) want you to be. Chat to girls any opportunity you have, let go of any expectations you might have. Just talk and be friendly, you dont even have to go for their numbers until you get used to speaking to them. Go through the HARD WORK of being REJECTED, feeling awkward while chatting to a HOTTIE (like you did when you were LEARNING to drive) feeling NERVOUS for your DATE, etc. Do it all now, and you wont regret it.Dont EXPECT anything, just tell yourself: Im going to approach that gorgeous girl over there, I dont care what happens, itll just make it easier when I meet the next one.Youll gain so much confidence, and the rest (sense of humour, etc) will follow. You will eventually meet a girl who will LIKE you for who you have BECOME. You will be REAL, you wont need to pretend, because you have LEARNT to be CONFIDENT and CHARMING, through PRACTICE.Why dont you try going out (not dating, I mean as in a relationship) with the FIRST girl you meet, you ask? What would be the point, you wanted to change, youre not going to change much after meeting one girl. If you break up with her, youll not know how to meet girls, you didnt practice enough.The point is, if I met that HOT girl at university at the BEGINNING of the year, she would not have liked me. Period. Why? Because at the beginning of the year I was still shy, and didnt have the qualities (which Id developed) that I do now. She liked the NOW-me, not the OLD-me.If youre going after girls that expect qualities you dont have (confidence, etc) then youre going to have to DEVELOP those qualities through PRACTICE, so that one day youll have what it takes to get what you WANT.The girls youre going to chat up NOW might not be too impressed with you when you start PRACTICING. Because you havent yet got the qualities theyre looking for. Thats why their practice, thats why you shouldnt care. Its not them you want - its the girl 8 months from now, thats just like them, thats who you want! There are hundreds of girls out there suited to you! You can afford to throw a few away until you can finally keep one!REMEMBER: WORK HARD in the SHORT-TERM to achieve your LONG-TERM goal of SUCCESS in ANY facet of your LIFE.

Ok, i've been away from this site for a while being persecuted by the IT dept at work so I finally got hooked up to the net at home.Well this is my story from the weekend and I hope someone can appreciate the tip inside this story.I was part of a bridal party for my best mate's wedding and I knew a pretty hot girl was gonna be there but she wasnt on my 'hit list' for the day, but i did see how hot she looked that day.So in the limo we made some small talk and lots of joking around, I did my best to look like an idiot by doing my Zoolander "blue steel" pose everytime someone asked for a photo. She thought it was funny.Then during the reception, I was signing the wedding book and she bumped into me while I was standing so I remembered the guy from the movie "A night at the roxbury" and said the to her "Did you just touch my ass?" and she looked at me shocked but started smiling in disbelief (i was in disbelief as well but I had to say something than the usual "hi" and then the awkward silence).I then said to her "its ok, cause my ass is pretty hot, here..take a photo of it" (she had a camera in her hand) - and she did! I then go "I'll take a photo of yours" and she cracked up laughing and bent her hips sideways to show her ass and gave me her camera. CLick! Click!I then said, i'll take a proper photo of her and she says no....she calls someone nearby and asks if we can have a photo together...click click. During that photo I remembered a post on this site that went to the effect 'better to slap her ass and say hi toots than to have her think you're too nice and possibly gay' - so I my hand goes from her hip to a big slap on her left buttcheek and she giggles and the photo is taken. No slap on the face (I did a similar thing a few weeks ago during a food fight after a party where I rubbed yoghurt on the breasts of another chick 'in fun' and go a positive response - but she was married so no go there as i'm aiming for a LTR this time).Anyway, back to this chick at the wedding, I called her up today to see if the photos have been developed (good reason as any to make the call) she told me how funny the photos look and she's never meta guy who loves his own ass (laughing)....and we're meeting up for lunch on Friday.(She's threatened me with a $20 cancellation fee if I dont show up - so i'll take that as pretty high interest right?).Well the tip in all this story is in the title, think on your feet and dont think too much in how stupid you look.You dont need to impress all the women, you just have to get the attention of one.Now lets hope I can take this further than lunch......and she's a babe too

    <h3>
    'Love' 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


AFCs fall in love all the time. They pine, dream, sweat, fantasise and generally drool over their special beloved. Who meanwhile is off fvcking lots of other guys. So what's the deal? Here's a big secret for all you AFCs out there:LOVE is a lie invented by women to make guys do what they want. Isn't a guy in love the perfect AFC? He's attentive, he's 'kind', he's demonstrative, he gives a chick lots and lots and lots and lots of attention. He nobly sacrifices his feelings for her benefit. He sees her as the perfect princess (she believes) she really is. He apologises when she gets mad at him, *whether it's his fault or not.*And all of that crap. Why do AFCs do this? Because men have been lied to. We have been told that when love is involved, people will do anything to make each other happy. And if you love someone then *of course* you want what's best for them. Which means they'd be stupid not to love you right back. Which in turn means you'll both get to be happy. Riiiiiiiiiight. We all know what really happens. Most women don't go for guys who 'love' them. They go for guys who excite them, frighten them, give them an adrenaline rush and can keep their little puzzies moist by acting like real men. So why do AFCs *still* do it? Here's the real reason. All of that crap about a woman's specialness, uniqueness, all of that is a crock - AFCs do this *because they believe quality puzzy is impossible to find.* Especially for them. So they either try to buy it with attention. Or they don't try at all. They don't have the confidence to do a man's job on it. When their balls get busted, they fall apart because they realise that *they cannot do a man's job.* They have completely bought the women's line that there is not enough puzzy to go around, and it's a woman's job to ration it. (Which of course means none for the AFCs, who are really sweet, and if this woman wasn't already seeing someone else, then maybe...)And that, guys, is what 'love' is all about. Under the romance and the dreaminess is white-knuckle terror that they can't look after themselves and go for what they want like real men do. If a chick takes an interest in them - alleluia! No more white knuckle rides. How can they not 'love' someone like that?The downside is - the woman now has them completely by the balls. This is very bad. It is much worse than you can even begin to imagine.But... there is a cure for this chumpdom, and it is the theory and practice of DJhood. On the road to mastering the DJ way you will discover many things. Some of the most important is that you *can* get the puzzy you want. And that no woman is truly unique. And that there are literally millions of women out there who will give up the loser they are currently with for a quality guy like you. But most of all you will learn that if you start playing the love game the old AFC way and 'having feelings' for a woman any time before she's earned exclusivity by making your life a paradise, you are *out* on your ass before you've even started. So *forget* the AFC approach of getting exclusive on a woman before you've even started dating. That is a guaranteed plane crash to burning loserville hell. Whether you want easy sex or an LTR, the way to get it is to date a lot, with lots of women at the same time, and don't even think about playing keepers with the ones that don't make you happy. It's your choice, not theirs. If they don't like it - there *really are* millions of other women out there. Why should you waste time on someone who's sapping your time and enery and giving you nothing but pain and grief and frustration when you could be putting that energy into finding and being with someone else who's way more fun?If you are an AFC you will either be thinking at this point that Wildthang is evil and sexist and has *no idea* about real love, especially not the sort you're now feeling. Or perhaps, if you're a less terminal case, you'll be thinking that you get it now, and everything will be cool from now on. Not so fast. These delusions of 'love' are persistent. They have been sown deep in your mind. As soon as you start dating, women will do everything they can to yank the strings that lead to them.You *must* resist. You must learn to stand your ground, and not fall into the old ways. You must believe - absolutely, unquestioningly, without thinking - that the DJ quest for women is something you do for you, and you alone. And that's when you can start to have some real fun.

    <h3>
    Major Insight 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Gusy, I came to a major insight yesterday.The big insight is in the use of one single word, BABY. I'll explain a little later.For a long time I'd been trying to figure out how to sexualize a conversation with a woman you want right from the start.Because you know how you're supposed to reveal your interest right away, right?Well I experimented this week with telling chicks right off the bat, right after meeting them, that I was going to try to get their number.I did this using humor saying, "Well, you know, I really stopped by to ask you about your shoes (I asked them a question about their shoes), but now that I'm here, I'm going to have to get your number."I thought this would be good because it would immediately reveal my interest, right?But it didn't work so well.In fact, right when I said I wanted to get her number, she would withdraw.There are a few reasons for this I think -- one, you're revealing your intentions; two, you're indicating that it's nothing about her personality that you like, as you've just been talking to her for a second.Anyways, so I was thinking, how can you sexualize a conversation right away.And I realized you can do so by using a term of address:BABY.When I first thought of this, I thought, nah, that can't work, that's cliched, it's considered sexist, a chick will get offended, and more.But then I realized that all of my negative thoughts about using that word to refer to a girl came from cultural conditioning -- pretty much the feminist movement.And so I decided to try it.  I addressed a hot girl using the term -- and immediately she knew I was into her.I said, "Hey baby, can you tell me what year your car is?"And she immidiately started playing with her hair, and more.But I was still a little apprehensive about using the term.  I guess I thought it might offend some girls.But then I realized that really hot girls probably are used to the term.Plus using the word I think WILL SHOW THAT YOU HAVE COMPLETE CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF.Because consider this:A NICE GUY WILL NEVER ADDRESS A GIRL HE DOESN'T KNOW USING BABY.Not ever.  Think about it.You know what else, I realized I never addressed my ex-girlfriend, my first girlfriend, using the word baby.I never did because maybe the word "baby" immediately establishes you as a dominant over the girl, and since she was my first girlfriend maybe I didn't get the confidence to go for that dominance...  Maybe we can get a (figurative) show of hands here on how many guys have frequently addressed their girlfriends or ex-girlfriends using the term "baby."  Anyways, I would suggest that guys field test using this term.And think about how very sexual it is.It's pretty easy to say to a hot girl.But imagine saying it to an older, dowdy woman!!!No way, right?  Well that shows how very sexual the word is.The question is (and I'll drop another topic on this), what type of tack do you take after you've sexualized the conversation by using the word "BABY"?PS, If you want to see the someone use the word BABY with great confidence, see the movie _Made_.  Vince Vaughn is a real pimp.  He's so confidence he just does not give a fukk.  [This message has been edited by BGC (edited 12-15-2001).]

    How to get over your shynes. Concrete tips, no vague ideas 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


I will try to give the shy people here some concrete tips for getting over your shyness instead of vague ideas. Also tips like: just do it! wont be here. Just doing it is NOT a good tip for shy people because they wont. Shyness is another word for insecure so if you realize that and except that fact your already on your way of curing your insecurity! why?? NOBODY wants to be insecure but on the other hand nobody minds being shy because other people are too. Well GUESS WHAT!!! shy is a word invented by the wussies who needed a nicer word for their chronic, mind-wrecking disease!!Ok. So now you know your insecure (like you didn't already deep in your heart hehe), What can we do about it,Just walk up to beautiful women and talk to them??Well if you can do this than why are you reading this?? YOUR NOT INSECURE!!on the other hand if your a bit insecure you WONT do this. Why?? Because it scares the SH*T out of you.So now we know that just doing it wont work, what WILL work??Hmmmm. that's what ill try to explain in this post.Why would you listen to this complete stranger??A good question indeed. Let me tell you a little about me. I was insecure. VERY insecure. and now im practically completely over this bad plague. So here come my tips.1 GET A LIFE!!Ok this IS a vague tip but I cannot tell you exactly what a life means for YOU!! some general things are:-STOP THINKING WOMEN ARE YOUR LIFE GOAL!!The greatest men on earth didn't have women on their mind. They had their mind on their greater goal which made them irresitable!! They had no time to obsess over some c*nt. They had to discover the north pole, climb the k2, conquer europe etc. A woman is INSIGNIFICANT compared to those things.-GET A PASSION!!Get something you like so much that your almost obsessed. You like painting?? Start painting like your life depends on it, Eat, sleep, breath painting!! Don't force yourself onto something you wont like. everyone has SOMETHING they are obsessed about, most people just haven't discovered what it is. How will you recognize what it is??When you discovered it you just know it.-START WORKING OUT!!Get your body in shape. You'll have more energy and you will appear much more lively to everyone you talk to or who just sees you.After these tings your life will seem much more important than ANYTHING else. YES! YOU are the next picasso, napoleon, neil armstrong or whoever is your inspiration!!2- Get a jobGet a job in which you work with alott of people or in which you HAVE to talk to a lott of people. Start working in a big store for example. At start it's scary talking to all the people but after a while it becomes second nature.3-Talk to everone one you could easily talk to but just didn't.For example. Talk to that class mate who's always annoying, or that collegue who's only talking about chess all day. You KNOW you know some people you could easily talk to but just don't talk to because there's something you don't like about them. Well you can go back to hating them as soon as your over your insecurity, but since you are now, practice your socializing skills on those people because if you f*ck up talking with them you wont care!4- Go out!!This one is more aimed at the younger people (25-). Go out. Get offline and go out. Every friday and saturday go out!! go to the club with some friends and have a good time. Dance. Socializing at a club is easy because everybody is there because they want to socialize. Talk to people you vaguely know from something (hey wasn't I in the same school with you blablabla). Ok now don't stop going out until you are comfortable going out ALONE!! (or until you run out of money  ). When you are comfortable going out alone you probably have alott of vague aquantances which leads to point 5- Act like your the hostA host talks to everyone he knows even if only vaguely. EVEN if they don't like someone very much, because it only means that you don't know that person good enough. When you have come to the point of being comfortable talking to vague aquantances, start talking to their friends. This way you will get to know your friends friends friends friend. Which means you will know ALOTT of people. and because you have to talk to them you will start becoming more and more comfortable talking to people you barely know which will eventually end up in you talking to complete strangers.These are just the basic things I did to become the current me. If I tell people that deep in my heart im a shy little F*CK, they laugh their @ss off because they don't believe me. HELL I don't even believe me when I say it   If you have some more concrete tips post them. you owe it to that small insecure little B!TCH you were  ------------------Those are my principles. If you don't like them I have others. - groucho marx[This message has been edited by extravaganza (edited 12-12-2001).]

 3 years ago my dream was to visit ITALY.  I planned the one 1/2 month trip during 7 months. I was excited!

I was excited! I was FEELING GOOD!!! I remember walking around old streets of FIRENZE, the chicks from every part of the world would stare at me! I am not kidding, they use to stop, and watch me goes by!! IT WAS AMAZING!!! I remember some spanish chicks saying "mira mira il pazzo!!!" (hey! look at that guy!!!)   ) I had a wonderful time at the hotel room. If you are feeling really good about yourself, chicks will feel it in their puzzy  ) THIAGO

    How to cut down on your rejection rate by 99% 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Make eye contact. Smile. Wave. If she smiles and waves back, then approach. I've been going clubbing with my friends often and I've been observing guys trying to pick up in the club/bar setting, just to see different approaches and what works.Nearly EVERY time I've done this, I am successful meeting a girl. In fact, after adopting this technique, I can't remember the last time I was rejected outright. The reason this works is most guys are like desperate, hungry pit bulls. They're so frustrated and horny, they don't even stop to subjectively observe their surroundings. They just see a girl, and do the classic gino "sneak-behind" maneuver. Where they scoot up behind the girl and start grinding. Sure, some sluts go for this for a while, but they never take the guy seriously enough to meet him outside that moment. I have seen literally hundreds of guys get rejected using this weak ass technique. When you make eye contact, smile and wave, you test her to see her interest. Your smile must be big and confident with a little c0ckiness. Your wave must be like you already know her from way back. Look CLOSELY at her reaction. Most packs of girls react to this by giggling and huddling to talk about me. Taht's when I know I could pretty much have any of them. I'm instantly the center of attention. So try it. Jake

Greetings my Fellow DJ's!Once again, I'll post one of the tips I've picked up along the way on this journey towards Don Juan-dom.Tip:  Pursue and date more than one woman at a time.Read it again; it's important.I can't count the times I've read a post by some guy who pines away for the "perfect" girl only to find out she's got a boyfriend, or isn't interested.  He then logs on here and sobs uncontrollably until we tell him to buck up and grow a pair and move on.How can such a scenario be avoided?  Easy.  Never try to pursue only one woman at a time! But Gipper, I hear you ask, how does this help?  I'm in love!No you're not, dammit!You are infatuated, at best.  This realization came to me after I had actually succeeded in dating two women over the course of a weekend.  I felt no pressure on either date, and had a great time with both.  I was attracted to both women, but I didn't know them.I think part of the problem is how a lot of us are brought up to think that we must see only one woman at a time, or we are perceived as cads or 'gasp', players.  You must think in a new paradigm (although I hate such buzzwords).  You cannot, I repeat, cannot fall in love with one woman after going out with her once and twice.  In fact, I will go so far as to say it will take you many weeks and months before choosing a woman you deem worthy of a long-term relationship.What are the benefits of such a technique?1. You don't become obsessed with one girl.  If this girl is your only hope for romance or sex, she becomes overly important to you, which makes you too careful about how you act around her.  You can't be lighthearted and fun, which really hurts you in the long run.2. You can gauge which girl is really more fun to be around.  If you only see one girl, your mind may play a trick on you, making you believe she likes you a lot more than she really does.3. If one girl bails on you, you have a backup.  This should be enough reason to try multiple chicks.4. It's great practice.5. It makes it easier to approach new girls.  Hey, if she rejects you, so what?  You're already seeing someone.  I could probably think of some more reasons, but you should get my point by now.Don't believe me?  Fine.  But at least try dating two or more women at once.  It will be one of the greatest DJ experiences you will ever have.Gipper

    true story about being a challenge 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Ok, about a year and whatever ago, I ran track and I didn't have a care in the world, not women, not money, not anything...then I bump into this 10 girl(that seemed to find my wits charming) and I tell her up front that I don't want a relationship or anything(cuz my full attention was at training for the fall cross country season)...so then she pursues me more and more. She begs me to come to her b-party, I decline giving some excuse. You know what she said? "you're the first guy who hasn't pursued me like all my exs." Then she emails me, talks about me to her friends and before you know it we're makin' out in her house. Then I tell her we can only be a fling for the summer...first she is very upset and argumentative, but she then writes back telling me if that's all I can give, then she'll take it, that I am so "sweet and caring" and blah, blah. She spent the whole summer trying to convince me to make us more than a fling.Take notes...I was a challenge without even knowing it. But I became far less of a challenge as I gave in. I saw her more often in the summer (every single weekend, and I ditched my other friends' plans for her) and I NEVER TRAINED FOR THE TEAM IN THE FALL LIKE I WANTED TO. I DIDN'T EVEN MAKE THE TEAM CUZ I WAS PUTTING A LOT OF TIME INTO THIS GIRL. She wanted me to stop running and I did, for a while. (more evidence of being whipped)  After a while, I saw a different side of her, the angry b#tchy side. Don't get me wrong, she normally was a very nice girl and that's the reason I thought I had to become super nice and treat her well and come to her every whim. Well, eventually she gave me the boot and I was devastated...I hadn't run in months, I was off the team, and my grades were horrible. She later told me that the "spark" was gone. I had her LAST on my priorities when I first met her. For some strange reason, this made her want me more. She would write me these huge emails about how she missed me and blah blah. Anyway, I am back to running now, grades are better, and after reading some of the stuff on here, way more understanding when it comes to women. I had lost control of my life to a girl and I am just tellin' ya even the nicest of girls will pull the plug on you if you don't keep her guessing and leave her wanting more. The way you do that is simple...just keep doing whatever you were doing before you met her...sports..anything.DON'T EVER GIVE IT UP FOR HER! That'll show her that even if she dumps you, you are still happy and you wouldn't give a two-bit damn because you're occupied with your own life.  -true story!

    Make Her Feel Special 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


The most important thing you can do to make single women feel romantically attracted to you is to make her feel special. Women are a lot less interested in the way you appear to her than in the way to make her feel about herself. It's very important to make single women feel special and unique. In return, she will feel that you are also special and unique. So, how do you make a single woman feel special? You tell her by saying something like this: "There's something very special about you. I noticed you the second I first saw you. You have a very unique face that's so exotic I can't explain it. You're more than just attractive. There's something very unique and original about your look." Just say this to a woman you've just met and watch her reaction. I can guarantee you her face will light up with a smile and she will radiate warmth towards you. So, remember when you're out on the prowl looking for romance,sex, or a relationship, don't forget to tell women that there's something special about them. Make them feel that they are the most important and special person on the earth. If you can do this, you're love and sex life will skyrocket! This article contributed by Don Diebel.

    <h3>
    Ways of thinking 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Situation:Eyecontact with a girlState of Mind:I am confident.I am attractive.I am interesting.I am a fun person to be with.I am a challenge.I am controlling the situation.When you look at a girl aim your face (your head too) to a spot below her eyelevel and at a spot that is not directly in front of her.Now when she looks your way lift your head a little (stay below her eyelevel) and look up a little.Look in her eyes.(Think about how much you want her.Think "I want you very bad")Hold it a little longer than the average look and look back to where to you were looking.You can flirt with her and look at her while you're talking with a friend.In this case you can be on the same eyelevel or higher.This shows that you've got everything under control; both the flirting and the conversation with your friend and makes you look professional and confident.Flirting from a balcony would give you superior position and she will have to look up to you.Isn't that what you've always wanted?Situation:Being Don JuanState of Mind:Every woman is beautiful in her own way.Every woman is beautiful.Some type of women I find beautiful; One can sing and has a very sexy voice.Many of the women I like have beautiful eyes.Another drinks beer.The icecream-grandma can make icecream I can eat kilo's of. Iris is so beautiful because she likes me.Karen makes me feel so good when she smiles.Angelique is so spontaneous.Tanja has good figures.Melanie Chisholm enjoys her life and that makes her attractive to me.Carrie Ann Moss looks so good in leather.Audrey is so independent and that makes her very very attractive.Nicole knows what she wants and that's why she is so beautiful.Simone is my age and that makes her beautiful..Why all these examples? Because:"Unfortunately no one can be told what beauty is.You've got to experience it for yourself."Situation:Looking goodState of Mind:I have to look good all the time.It will also add intensity to my confidence if I don't have to worry about looking good.You even have to look good at home when you are on your own.It's easy only looking good on Saturday evenings.The goal is to look good at home, while digging a hole in the garden, when your sick at home.You never know man.Your sexy neighbor can come to the door to ask for your help on fixing her batterycharger or she can suddenly decide that it doesn't need to be fixed because she has found you; clean, handsome, fresh looking man who looks like a sexbomb.Remember that personal hygiene contributes a considerable amount of power to your looks making you look more attractive.Situation:You have to chooseState of Mind:I am a man and can choose without hesitating too much.When you have to choose something think fast and choose.You have to eliminate all the unimportant factors.Like you have to choose between a Big Mac and a Quarter Pounder.Forget the bread, the meat and all other stuff.What is the special thing that makes a Big Mac ? Right, the sauce.The rest is not that important.Do you want to go for the sauce ? Yes choose the Big Mac or No choose the Quarter Pounder but don't think too long.McDonalds has been there longer .You can always go back.When you need a moment say: "Let me think for a second" with the more important things that you have to choose.Don't let people hear you think.Don't look tensed.Try to response to people when you are thinking.It shows that you can take more brain activity.Situation:Fear pops up.Problems form.State of Mind:I will solve the problem right away.Or else it will invade my thoughts when I don't want it.There is no problem I can't take.I'll deal with it.I do not fear problems.When fear pops up I'll be it's puppetmaster.It's a host in my body so I control it.Fear.That's the sensation a Don Juan needs to control.If he does not control it it will control him.If the Don Juan does not eliminate his fear it will show up at critical times and spread all over like a cancer. Draining all the common sense out of him.Why do tomorrow what you can do today ? Maybe tomorrow you will have to focus your attention on something else.Like fixing the valves of a space shuttle or something.Remember the times that you said to yourself that you would clean your room but decided to do it tomorrow and tomorrow you decided to do it the day after and so on.With problems and with fear you have to deal with it right away to avoid a snowball-effect that will swallow you eventually.You're the man, right? Be one then.The world has a shortage on real men.Real men are rare and will get all the attention like that rare baseball-card the guy across the street has that everyone wants to get his hands on.How can you change yourself if you can't even know your own breath smells bad? Extrapolate. Look at yourself like you are someone else looking at you.Be objective.Ask people what they think about your hair.Women love to evaluate aesthetic properties.So ask them.Don't be shy."Go ahead! Make my day!" (Harry Callahan)[This message has been edited by stockholder (edited 10-14-2002).]

    How to Handle Rejection From Women 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


How to Handle Rejection From WomenRejection, rejection by a woman, rejection by the woman, the woman who has captured your thoughts, the woman whose smile sends shivers of warmth down your spine, the woman whose touch you dream of ...  this icy doom fills you with dread.  It is the utter desolation of helplessness.  It is the worm of self-doubt.  It is the gripping fear that warns you to abandon hope. Rejection is a part of everyday life.  People are turned down for raises, refused promotions, declined for loans, and passed over for recognition.  Rejection is not final.  Rejection is not ruin.  Indeed, rejection can be the precursor to eventual success. There is nothing personal about rejection.  It happens to everyone. It is part of "the cost of doing business".  It is intimately connected with risk taking.  Every worthwhile endeavor at some point involves the risk of failure.  This is what makes life interesting. It is only by risking our persons from one hour to another that we live at all.  And often enough our faith beforehand in an uncertified result is the only thing that makes the result come true. Consider a rejection as a "second opinion" of sorts.  The woman who rejects you might well have sounder judgment in the matter of a possible relationship than you.  She may have compelling reasons for her conclusion that you are ill suited for each other, saving the both of you a great deal of future grief.  This does not, of course, mean you are worthless as a person, just that she was not meant for you, and that you should find someone else. There are techniques that can remove some of the sting from the fear of rejection.  Simply "scoping the situation out", proceeding in small steps, rather than taking the grand plunge all at once is a prudent method of risk management.  Asking a woman you have just met to become intimately involved with you is an enterprise almost certain to fail. Asking her to share five minutes over a cup of coffee is a more modest proposal, one much more likely to meet with her approval (after that, she may hint, or even let you know outright if she is willing to go farther).  Tackle tricky situations in small increments. When you do face rejection, and you will, accept it with good cheer. Bounce back and try again (presumably with a different woman). Continued life experience will desensitize you to the trauma of having doors slammed in your face.  You learn to survive.  You learn to go on.  You learn to keep trying. Since everything in life is but an experience perfect in being what it is, having nothing to do with good or bad, acceptance or rejection, one may well burst out in laughter.Don Diebel www.getgirls.com ------------------"Women.

    <h3>
    Complaining, whining, and crying... 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


     I'm tired of would be Don Juaners complaining about women.  If I were to have my way, all complaining, whining, and crying would be banished to another forum, which I could ignore.     A Don Juan has no business complaining about women.  Did Sir Edmund Hillary complain that Everest was too high?  Did Winston Churchill complain that those Nazis were just too creepy?  Did Chef Boyardee complain that pasta in a can could never be affordable, yet tasty?     I submit to you that the answer is no.  There are women out there, and some guys are going home with them... every night.  The blame is not women, what they want or what they say.  The problem is us.  When we don't get what we want from life, women or the sno-cone lady we need to look at where we failed, and what we can do better next time.     I constantly hear complaining that women don't want what they say they want.  Of course they don't!     If an interesting attractive woman were to ask us what we wanted in a woman we met in a bar, how many of us would say huge chest, tight little bubbly ask, and a complete willingness to do unmentionable things to us three hours after first hello?     The answer is none of us.  Ahhh... there the lament begins.  How are we to know what to do?  How can we solve this riddle?  Are we destined to be alone and confused forever?     The answer, however, is there to be discovered.  Our question is answered every single time we turn on the TV... it is answered every time we go outside... it is answered every time things don't go as we expected they should have gone.     The answer is simple.  We must look not at what women say they want, but rather at what women act like they want.  Nowhere do actions speak louder than words more aggresively than with the opposite sex.     In his first attempt to get a girl to like him, a boy will usually go out of his way to be nice.  He will do everything he can to convince her that he is the sweetest thing around and she should love him.     This often fails.  The nice boy looks around and becomes angry at the world.  He is jealous of others that have better luck with women and he becomes tired of hearing about women letting jerks have their way with them, and then complaining to the "nice guy"     After enough disappointment the "nice guy"'s disgust boils up within him.  He resolves to become one of those "jerks".  Indeed, he has more success than before.  He acts more confident and as a result has more women.     Many never leave this phase of development.  However, if the jerk can calm down... if the nice guy within him could take a breath and calmly evaluate the situation he can become more.  He can become a Don Juan.     Indeed, the original "nice guy" was not really mad at women.  He was mad at his lack of understanding of women.  Had he calmed down and looked at the actions of the women... not the words... he could have saved himself much more agony.     Repeatedly, the one personality type that women are drawn to is the hero.  The hero has the kindness of the nice guy, with the confidence of a jerk.  Romance novels have example after example.  Indeed, the one character that time and time again women give as a "fantasy man" is James Bond.     James Bond is a very nice guy.  He is on the side of right, he is kind and exemplifies goodness.      What he is not is a puppy dog, he is not a coward, he will not be controlled by a woman, and he would never put up with silly games.     He is strong, the confidence of a jerk, without the emotional baggage.  If a woman didn't return Bond's calls, wouldn't go to bed with him, tried to kill him, etc...  Bond doesn't get upset.     He doesn't get upset because he doesn't need to.  He knows that whatever he wants is right there for him around the turn.  Indeed, frequently the women don't sleep with Bond right away.  Its Bond's deep confidence (not shaken by a woman's rejection) that women find sexy.       Incidentally, it seems to me that most successful Don Juan's have had experiences where a women said NO... and the DJ's calm, detatched acceptance of it lead to encounters later.     Indeed, a jerk is usually a nice guy lashing out.  There is no reason to be angry at a woman for being what she is.  Evolution has programmed her to be turned on by certain things.  The choice is clear... curse evolution, or learn what works and love life.     Biologically, women love strength.  Strength comes in many forms, and most of it turns women on.  Strong lean upper bodies turn women on...     Emotional strength turns women on as well...  if you are constantly complaining about women... or claiming to be a "nice guy" women won't view you as a potential partner.  Women need someone they can lean on...  You can't win love with pity.     Women are less visually turned on than men and more turned on by social context... In one study women were shown pictures of men both alone and with other women supposedly being tested as well, but actually in on the experiment.     When a woman thought other women found a man attractive, his stock skyrocketed...  on average 3s became 6s and 5s became nines.        There are a million examples that could go on and on.  Ultimately it is our choice.  We can choose to learn, appreciate and use the common quirks of women to our advantage, or we can complain, whine and cry that women aren't what we think they should be.       We can cry rivers... women will still be the same.  Its a blessing to the observant and a curse to the stubborn.

    Attitude: what to avoid, what to cultivate 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Lots of guys are stuck in the mindset of:"Oh my God! She's so hot! I can't believe how full her lips are!  Full pouting beautiful... (cue hardon)  I've got to approach her!  But no, she's too... Oh, those tight black pants... God!  What would she ever want with me?  How could I ever convince her to... what a pair of breasts.  Sucking on them... oh my god... gotta approach, cause I'm a loser if I don't... oh, I'd give my leg for one night with her!  Oh..." (cut off by the narrator's de-evolution into a drooling mess.)Vivid?  Sure.  I'm The Writer.  You know how they say that it's best to write about what you know?  Well, I know about the above.  It's how I used to think.AND THINKING LIKE THAT NEVER DID ME, OR ANYBODY ELSE, ANY GOOD.What you've got to do is to cultivate this attitude instead:1. I don't need a woman in my life.  She'd just take away from my time.  Wouldn't mind having a woman, but I really don't care one way or the other.  Women are near the bottom of my list of priorities.  Why do they keep throwing themselves at me?2. All those chicks are out to get my ****.  God, why do they need me so bad?  Just because I'm one of the few people on earth who could give them what they truly want...  Matter of fact, it'd be charitable of me to give them any kind of intimacy.  Poor desperate souls.3. But know what, I'm a charitable kind of guy.  I love making people happy.  And since I know that just smiling at her will make her day, I could maybe persuade myself to take some time out of my busy schedule to walk over there and chat her up, make her feel like a star.100% different.  And 100% irresistible.[This message has been edited by The Writer (edited 06-07-2001).][This message has been edited by The Writer (edited 06-07-2001).]

    How to Pursue Single Women 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


PS: Large file; if you want it, e-mail me and I'll be happy to send you a copy.How to Successfully Pursue Single Women1) Playing hard to get is very important. You must appeal to her power of seduction. Let her use her sensuality and sexuality to catch you. The important thing is that once you know a single girl is interested in you, you can appeal to her power of seduction by playing hard to get.  Dont call her every night. Dont make big sexual moves on her at first. You must appear interested, yet still holding back a bit  not quite sure if you want the relationship to go further. Make her feel as though she has to work harder to convince you that you do want the relationship to develop.2) Convince the girl that she is more interested in you than you are in her.  Example: End the date before she does. Youve gone out and now you are having a bite to eat at a restaurant. Instead of letting the date drag on to that awkward time when she finally says she has to go home, maintain control of the evening. While the conversation is still going well, announce that its getting late and its time to go. Tell her that you enjoyed the evening and that you are looking forward to getting together again.       	This is going to surprise her, since most guys think, that by some miracle, if they hang on long enough that maybe theyll convince women to have sex with them. If a girl wants to have sex with you, shell let you know. So if you havent gotten the vibes, end the date while it is still going well. Youll set yourself apart from the other guys shes used to. You demonstrate that you are not easy to get.Example: Dont rush things sexually with single women. Appear as if you are still deciding whether or not you want to be involved. The first example in this section of ending a date before she does, is a great way to accomplish this. Also, if the mood, the time, the place isnt right, or it feels the slightest bit awkward, dont try kissing her for the first time. If shes interested, the time and place will come. But, by pushing it, you risk blowing an important event, you risk coming off as being desperate for action and worst of all, you risk appearing inexperienced and inept. Dont be afraid to wait until the time is right.Example: Dont always be available to do something with her. You have called a girl and asked her to go to a movie on Tuesday and she declines Dont say, Well, how about Wednesday? or What day can you make it? Simply say, Thats too bad you cant make it. Maybe some other time. Talk to you later. You have to avoid making it sound as if you are free any time she wants you.3) Dont always do what women expect you to do. Someone who does exactly what is expected on cue is boring. By being a little unpredictable, you become elusive, you keep women on their toes, wondering about you, and slightly insecure with respect to where they stand. If they expect you to try and make a move sexually  dont. If they expect you to ask them out for Saturday night, ask them out for Tuesday night. If they think you arent interested, call out of the blue. If they expect you to call that night, call the next day.4)       You must convince a girl that she would be lucky to be with you. You may do this to a great extent just by properly presenting yourself with your image.Examples: Dress as well or better than her. Be knowledgeable about the movie, the dinner, the wine, politics, or whatever. Look good but dont brag about yourself all the time. Theyve have heard bull before and they wont fall for it. Let your image speak for you. By keeping the conversation aimed at her, and paying really close attention to what she says, this will say a lot about you.	Another way to convince a girl that shell be lucky to be with you is to play on her inadequacies. This has to be subtle so you dont come off as being negative.Examples: If it comes up in the conversation that shes never been to Hawaii, accent the fact with, Really, youve never been there? You should go sometime. If she mentions that she does not like her job, say, Its hard to work in those conditions. You should get out of a situation that makes you unhappy. If she mentions a health problem, ask a few questions about it to accent the fact that she is not perfect. If she exposes an insecurity, ask why she lets that bother her.5) On the first get-together, talk only about her  not yourself. By talking about her, you learn more about her, which will be valuable to you in planning strategy. Also, it is a subject she will be comfortable with. By not talking about yourself, you let your image speak for itself. And dont forget, the less women know about you, the more women want to know about you. Be a man of mystery.6) Finally, when you first get to know a girl, it would be better if she suspects that you are seeing other women as well as her. It makes you more attractive to her and she knows she will have to work hard to get you.How do you suggest that there are other women in your life? Just doing all the things suggested above: Playing hard to get; not rushing into sex; not calling every night; not always being available; and being unpredictable.------------------"Women.

You know that moment right after you get a smile from a girl. . . How you seem to lift up inside. . . And you carry with you a little smirk because you're ego has just been stroked.Ever notice how right after you get a look from one girl, is when you are most likely to get a look from another?  How it's almost as though there were no middle ground. . . you can either get zero looks or six?  Why is this?  I have an idea.Right after I got a look from a girl the other day, a guy came up to me and said that I had a look like I knew something. . . like I had a secret that nobody else was privy to.  And I did have a secret.  I had a girl's heart, and nobody knew it but me.I think the reason for repeated success is this look.Think about it. . . if you look like you have a secret the rest of the world will never know, it makes you appear confident and mysterious.And women love confident and mysterious.

    <h3>
    10 TIPS! USE THEM! 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


O.K., youve spotted her across the crowded room.  In your mind, youre confident that shes the one.  You slowly make your way to her.  Your heart is pounding.  Your palms are sweating.  You reach her. and thenYou open your mouth.  You blow it!  No second chances, bub.  Tip #1:   Dont request a date immediately.  Wait until a conversation first occurs before asking her out.  For Gods sake, at least find out her name first!  If she doesnt know who in the world you are no matter how nice, charming or goodlooking you may be, chances are VERY slim that shes going to want to go out with a complete stranger.  Tip #2:  Dont pounce upon her the minute that she walks into the place.  A woman wants to become accustomed to her new surroundings, have a drink, talk to friends or relax before being rushed by a man who descends on her like a vulture to prey.  Let her start enjoying herself before making your first move. Tip #3:  Dont overdo it with flattery or flowery compliments.   Your eyes light up the room like moonlight on still waters...Pleeeeease!  Even if youre sincere when throwing her a line like that. shes going to have a tough time swallowing it.  Compliments are all well and good, but dont overdo it.  When you DO say something nice, go for a nice casual comment like You have a great smile as opposed to Nice rack ya got there!. Tip #4:  If buying her a drink, dont expect a miracle.  She may say thank you, but even thats no guarantee.  Better to send her a drink anonymously.  This conjures up an element of mystery or intrigue that can inspire her to investigate the sender and personally thank you.  This can lead to a conversation which can lead to whatever. Tip #5:  When approaching a group of women, dont hit on one after another.  Use your head.  Every woman wants to feel special.  If she sees you going from woman to woman like Musical Chairs, that special factor is tossed right out the window. Tip #6:  Dont be desperate, overanxious or pushy.  Respect her space and dont get grabby or physical.  So many men ignore this rule.  Theres a big difference between being pleasantly persistant and being an absolute nuisance.  Keep your encounter with her conversational and friendly.  Dont ruin it by putting your arm around her.  You may think youre suave and debonair.  Chances are, she thinks youre an ******* . Tip #7:  Ask for her phone number ONLY if you plan on using it.  If youre lucky enough to actually get her phone number on a napkin, your job is only half complete.  Dial her up.  She wouldnt give you her number if she didnt want you to call her. Tip #8:  Ask her out at least two or three days in advance.  Dont try to rush the date.  This wreaks of desperation.  Play it cool, boy.  Good things come to those who wait. Tip #9:  Dont ask her to go away with you on a vacation, to a wedding or an office function.  Youve just met her!  She barely knows you, so a trip to Tahiti or your cousins barmitzvah are not prime choices for a first date. Tip #10:  Spend the money on breath mints.  Otherwise, youll never get past hello.

    Patience: What truly makes a Don Juan 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


I have observed guys that had it all (looks, confidence, experience, and even interest from the women). I was envious of these guys for they seemed to know what they were doing and knew how to do it well. I was in awe of how they could be so smooth with the ladies. Their abilities amazed me.Where I worked at, there were a couple of women who all the guys wanted. These women had initial interest in the guys mentioned above (and as you can imagine, those guys had quite a bit of interest in them). So the guys moved in for the kill. They unleashed their charm, their wit, their humor to get the women they so desperately desired.In the end, both women had ditched these guys and went out with me.So what happened? How could guys with more experience, confidence, wit, and looks be shot down by the most in-demand women in the area? And how could someone like me (who lacks in these certain areas) succeed when such smooth ladies-men fail?It all has to do with patience. These guys failed because they came on entirely too strong, too fast. After a couple of dates, they wanted to marry the person. Though they were smooth, they could not hold back their desire for a girlfriend. The women sensed this and recoiled from them instantly.Women, on initial dates, just simply want to have fun and have a good time. Men can throw too much affection too soon, too fast, and scare the woman off. Women find this as 'desperation'. It is the ultimate turn-off to them.Patience is NOT inaction nor 'chickening' out. Not asking out a woman you're interested in is not being patient but being stupid. Patience is controlling your eagerness.Have fun with the woman. Don't take your outings so seriously. A woman must feel comfortable and secure with you before intimacy can begin. The key to her feeling comfortable and secure is by having fun WITH YOU.Patience is also outstanding at ATTRACTING women too. Those Mr. Smooth men I knew would be there at a second one of the women called their names. If she said, "Hi, [Mr. Smooth Dude's Name]" they would stop what they were doing and talk. I, on the other hand, simply greeted them back and KEPT WALKING. The Mr. Smooth men came across as eager and desperate by always willing to stop whatever they were doing to chit chat while I gave the impression of 'importance' and 'hard to obtain' by controlling my eagerness.Older women (who are married and in their 40s, 50s) have told me that one of the most common mistakes guys can make is trying to jump into a strong relationship after only a couple of dates. They said that women simply want to have fun and that if the guy smothers her with affection, she will distance herself. After all, who wants to be with someone that appears eager and desperate?Now I must choose between one of the two women I'm going out with (yes, going out with both). The Mr. Smooth guys now come TO ME and ask, "What's your secret? How were you able to get BOTH of them?" and I just smile.------------------Pook"As you think, you shall become."

I firmly believe that anyone can handle anyone else.. let it be a movie star.. or a little h00ker down the street.A lot of people doubt the fact that they could be going out with supermodels and stuff.. because they KNOW it. They KNOW the supermodels have a great life.. and have a lot of connections.. and those normal citizens KNOW that they're just normal. Its all in the mind. You can't just go up to someone with a great position in the community thinking to yourself "I'm confident.. I'm confident" and expect to pull things off. Thats thinking. You don't think.. you have to KNOW.Why get intimidated by 8-10 chicks when they only know how to laze at home calling up hunks? You KNOW you have a better life than them.. and they will be lucky if they ever have a chance to talk to you. Problem is.. people these days think they're confident enough to do anything they want to any chick, and in the end.. they screw everything up.Those guys with the chicks KNOW that they're superior. Thats why you don't see them fumbling for words when they see beautiful women. If you're having trouble with this.. pick up some sports.. get a musical instrument.. get a job. Study. Be someone useful in life. Have a hobby. After achieving all these.. you KNOW your life is meaningful.. and girls/women won't mean anything to you anymore. They will have to be the ones chasing you.. because you KNOW you can get any chick you want with the snap of your fingers, at the status you are in.So don't just think confident.. KNOW that you are the best.. never put up with any bu11sh1t.. respect yourself. That way you can succeed in every way in life. Good luck.

Picture this for  a moment.Your in the market for a new car. You visit 2 separate car dealerships. The first sales person comes at you, despirate to sell a car to you. Every time he makes an offer and you hesitate. He quickly lowers the price just to please you. Then you visit the second dealership, and the sales person appears very eligant and talks in a slow calm manner. He makes you an offer, and wether you accept his offer or not. He still maintains his pride. He doesn't lower his price drastically and as you think about the offer he has made. He says the following "This is a fine car, you get what you pay for. If you would like to pay the asking price, you can either take it . or leave it. someone else will surly purchase this car"  Now Imagin that you have an opportunity to get both of these cars for free. Which one would you purchase? The second deal of course. Because it automatically is preceived as being more valuable, because the salesman made it look like his car was in demand, and that it was worth having. while the first salesman seemed despirate. He made it seem as no one else wanted the car in the first place, so he would take what he could get for it.Well this is exactly how women judge a man. if he seems despirate(by calling all the time, or harrasing her for a date), he is worthless. Versus the man who maintains his dignity and pride, is always preceived as being valuable. This turns her on and can give the average looking guy a huge advantage over a very good looking guy. Try it, it works

Everytime you meet a little hottie.  Make nice, make your move, go for the phone number.Every time.  If you don't, then you blew it.  You should ask for her number the FIRST time you meet her.

So your in love with a particular girl and you want to know how you can get to know her better. Instead of going right out and asking her on a date, you can simply invite her to study with you at the library or join you for lunch. I have found that by wording things a certain way, my succuss in this area has gone through the roof. for example:APPROACH #1(The wrong way) "Do you want to come with me to the library?" - This kind of makes you sound despirate and makes it seem as though your afraid of going alone or something. where as the next approach almost always succeeds!APPROACH #@(The ideal way) "I'm on my way to the library, you welcome to join me." - Here your showing her that you would like her company, but you don't need it! Your showing her that wether she goes with you or not makes no difference to you whatsoever. And this is far favorable an impression to make on her that the first approach.   Try it  Rob,

More on Confidence from me:Do you ever get discouraged on your road to success with women? Does it seem like you're always going 2 steps forward, 1 step back?Take heart! Youre simply in step with the natural rythm of progress! Progress toward your goals is never going to be a straight line, there are always bumps in the road to send you off course. The trick is to avoid getting discouraged and get back on track. How?It's our thinking that either motivates us or doesn't. There are ways of thinking that create self-motivation.* Know that you are a Don Juan!Thats right! Every man has the capacity to be successful with a woman. Find your inner Don Juan. To experience this level of thinking all you have to do is commit to using your imagination! As adults we have become used to using our imaginations only for worrying. We visualize worst case scenarios all day long. Worry is a misuse of imagination, it was designed for better things. Use your imagination to create and acheive things that worriers never dream of acheiving. Use it not to escape reality, but to create it.  Be creative in your approach with women, dont just blindly follow what other have set.  You would be surprised as what you can come up with.  * Have Goals. Those with no central purpose in their life fall an easy prey to petty worries, fears, troubles, self-pitying and unhappiness. Create a vision of who you want to be and live in that picture as if it were already true. Be clear and specific. Don't let your goal be too small or vague(ie., Date the top of the line, dont settle for less). It will not be reached if it fails to excite your imagination.* A goal without action is a daydream.As stated, JUST DO IT.  Dont sit around and contemplate on how or when youre going to do it  JUST DO IT! * Make each day a masterpiece!Thats right, dont sit around in front of your TV or computer all day, go out and do something for crying out loud!  Focus on what you want and it will come into your life. Focus each day on what you are doing, not on the past or on the future. Focus on now.* Don't give into fear!General George Patton said, "Fear kills more people than death." It's true! Fear kills us over and over again. You need to find something(rejection, women) you fear and do it! See what happens. Fear is something that has held you back from doing things that would help you reach your goals with women. As a shy person you shrink back from calling a prospect on the phone or talking to some chick you met at the club or elsewhere. In life  we begin fearing what others think of us, afraid of looking bad we stopped taking risks. We can leave that behind by facing the fear that holds us back. Start talking to people you meet anywhere, even the bum next to you in the bus! If you survive this it will make you stronger and much more confident.

    <h3>
    How a Don socializes 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


 Many of my college friends ask how they can get girls to notice them. I tell them to be outgoing and sociable. I'll take them with me to a gathering and observe their techniques. What I often find is their inability or unwillingness to contribute in a conversation. I tell them that this is THE easiest way to sell yourself. Let me elaborate. Socializing is an artform that must be sculpted for one to be successful. A common mistake I find guys make is talking technical talk that few in the party will understand. Yes, he thinks he's leading an interesting conversation but rather, he is boring the masses with his monologue. A Don finds a topic that all can relate to and enjoy.  When trying to approach an unknown woman in a group, I find initially talking AROUND her works wonders. The indirect approach is extremely difficult to pull off and if glances, nervous smiles, and distance are not kept in check, she will call your bluff. Take note of those in her party and find connections with her friends and any aquaintances you have (Try and always have at least one). When you find mutual friends, enter their conversation. Talk to your buds and laugh and smile. Do NOT overdo it but be noticeable. Your buddy's girlfriends will introduce themselves or your friend will and as names pass, your targeted girl will come over as not to be left out. Smile coyly and keep the conversation flowing smoothly but still don't pay her too much attention. Look at her only if she speaks. As smaller chit chat circles form, find a way to be in hers. Keep talking around her but don't show any closed gestures and stay friendly. The key is to be socialable, just not with her. Be patient, she will wait awhile to see your actions. She will be intrigued with your demeanor and assume that you have status. By this time she will be dying for you to talk to her because any other schmuck would have hit on her by now. You however are a Don and keep your wits about you. Most likely she will be asking you so many questions that you don't need to do much (becuase you are now a man of mystery) but if she's shy, now start talking to her and another friend, each time making the conversation circle smaller and smaller until it's just you two. Then ask her related questions or how her pals know yours. This is making her comfortable with you because of mutual friends.  Keep your patience and stay relaxed. I've seen so many guys get this far and then blow it by showing too much interest too soon. If she gets up to go with her friends to the bathroom, don't trail her. She will notice. Stay where you are and talk to your friends and she will come back to you if she's interested (she is). Repeat process, add a dash of charm, she's ready for serving."Pimpin' ain't easy"-The Godfather------------------~milesman

    <h3>
    Be Selfish Agressive 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


This world is full of altruistic and unselfish ideologies, the common good is frequently taught to us as a goal in life: be giving towards others, treat women right, buy flowers for her, pay for dates, etc.  In the meantime, not knowing any better, men don't realize that these women who are in the receiving end are being spoiled.  Soon she becomes rather comfortable and later gets bored from all the attention that she gets from him.  Becoming unsatisfied she dumps Mr. Giving and searches for someone who is more of a challenge to tame.  Sound familiar?  Of course it does, this debate has been an ongoing issue in our lives.  Why does she like the jerk and not the nice guy?  Well, to sum it up in one word for a jerk: "Selfish"  The jerk realizes that we live insignificant lives; most of our decisions don't radically affect other human beings. But even in these decisions, should we consider other persons when making them? Or should we simply observe other organisms  whether humans or animals  as tools in our quest for pleasure?  You shoul start questioning everything that is not apparently clear. Therefore we must ask: Why should we care about anyone but ourselves? Shouldn't I just care about myself, coordinating all my actions to suit my stingy selfish purposes?Ask yourself "What is my objective of life?" What is everyone's basic objective of life? You'll agree that "pleasure", even being a vague concept, is a good definition. You know that it is your primary objective of life (why else would you be here asking for advice with women?)  besides, of course, sheer survival  the quest for pleasure, the quest for individual pleasure. Only your pleasure gives you pleasure, therefore only your pleasure is your basic living objective. Besides, when persons commit themselves more to causes or ideologies than to themselves they become fanatics that will only bring pain to them and others. One should always think about himself first and only then about women's needs, wants, desires, etc.I'm not saying that since you only care about yourself, you should not spend any resources in helping other persons achieve their own pleasure! That's very silly because in various circumstances you have to give pleasure in order to receive pleasure.  The approach one has towards life could  and should  be one of maximizing pleasure and seeking for the most individual happiness. This selfish and individualistic approach does not lead into a selfish behaviour but rather appear to be so.  You should be aggressive  but not violent. The reason why you should'nt try hard to control your aggressiveness is that you have a goal in your life that you first must achieve before you can rest in peace (that goal, again, is pleasure).  The more aggressive you are the more successful you will be with women.  It shows your confidence, it shows you can stand your ground, and it shows you're a MAN.  Jerks don't offer and provide women with enough emotional support and gifts (being giving).  These are things women hunger for and often seek out from men.  The jerk being selfish in nature acts only to satisfy himself and leave women lingering with thirst trying to get such things from the jerk which in turn becomes a "challenge" to obtain - it's what keeps them around.  On the other hand, the nice guy offers her all the things she wants and too much of it - which becomes stale after a while because she knows she can always have it and get it.  One last and final thought: defending selfishness is actually an unselfish action. A selfish individual favours and defends unselfish strategies because they are the ones that will allow him to explore the utmost out of others.

    <h3>
    On Respect 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


While so many guys on this board go on and on about confidence, I believe that respect is just as important, and is seriously overlooked.There are basically three types of respect:- The respect you get from others- The respect you give others- Self-respectAll of these types of respect must be earned.  Give respect where respect is due, but no good can ever come of undeserved respect.  (If you don;t believe me, take a good look at the current "leader of the free world".)Self-respect is probably the most important of the three, because you should never give anyone else more respect than you have for yourself.  Even this must be earned.  If you have no reason to respect yourself, than you will have no self respect.  Go out and improve yourself - take up a hobby, work out, volunteer in your community, do sports, improve your mind, whatever you feel you need to do to eliminate your shortcomings.The respect which you get from others is closely tied to your self respect.  Others will respect you for basically the same reasons you respect yourself, so self-improvement is even more important.  Remembering that respect must be earned, don't go around treating others like sh|t.  Nobody will have any respect for you, and being an ass just means that you have no self-respect and try to make up for it by pushing others around.The respect that you give others is also very important; this will directly affect all of your personal, professional, and intimate relationships (I'll just be talking about the latter, but everything here applies to all three).  Remember that this respect must also be earned.The most important rule to live by is that you should never, ever give anyone else more respect than you have for yourself.  If you have more respect for a girl than for yourself, than you are basically saying that you feel you are not worthy of her respect.  Consequently, you will find yourself, like Rodney Dangerfield, to be getting no respect.  If a girl doesn't respect you, she will have no qualms about using you and treating you like sh|t. If, through no fault of your own, your girl doesn't respect you, then you should show her no respect in return.  If she does something flagrantly disrespectful - e.g, talking sh|t about you to her friends, flirting with other guys in front of you, ignoring you, disrespecting you in front of your friends, cheating, etc. - you need to show her IMMEDIATELY that this kind of behavior absolutely WILL NOT be tolerated.  If this necessitates dumping her sorry ass, so be it.  Showing any tolerance for disrespect at all will irrevocably set the tone of your relationship in a way most decidedly detrimental to yourself, and your girl will continue to walk all over you.The only way to have a fulfilling relationship is if you respect yourself, your girl respects you, and you return her respect in kind.  Anything less is unacceptable.

    My two cents on confidence 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


To all the shy guys out there, get this : INSECURITY ISN'T SEXY. IT'S A MAJOR TURNOFF. Trust me on this one, a confident elephant man swimming in a pool of dung is more attractive than an insecure Tom Cruise. We all know this : an assertive fat a$$ will always be more sucessful than a cute, muscular queer boy. In a way, this is a miracle. Women rely almost solely on looks, but we have something called confidence. If youre an ugly girl, you lost the battle. If you are a shy guy, you can work hard an win the war. Plastic surgery is expensive. Self-growth only costs effort and discipline.Confidence isnt a God given gift. Confidence is hard work.The only way you can build situational confidence is EXPERIENCE.However, you can always increase your overall confidence. Heres how.*  Challenge yourself physically. There's nothing like learning a new physical skill to improve body confidence. When you were in high school, didnt you notice that chicks magnets were the ones who were rather active physically? Most of them were not particulaly big or cute, but they were energetic and active. Challenging yourself physically fills your body with endorphins. These are the #1 confidence boosters.* Dress for success. Buy clothes that fit well and feel good. You don't have to be handsome to be confident (eg : Danny DeVito). Make the most of your own unique physical assets and downplay your flaws so that you know you're giving out your best image.*  Dare to fail. Anybody who's out there genuinely striving is going to fail repeatedly. YES, YOU WILL GET REJECTED! YES, YOU WILL FEEL THE O SO HORRIBLE PAIN OF REJECTION (which is a million times less painful than the pain of regret by the way). If you're not failing, you're not trying. So don't take failure too hard or too personally. Just learn to roll with it and use its lessons to keep improving.*  When in doubt. Pretend you know what you're doing. Hesitation is probably the #1 turnoff in a man (along with putrid body odors). If you're confident of your abilities, by the time you're done, you will be competent.*  Adopt the physiology of confidence. Emotion is created by motion, so theres no way you will feel confident if youre always hunched over like Scooby-Doos friend, Sammy. Do you want to feel like sh!t ? Thy these : head lowered, shoulders slumped, eyes downcast, shallow breathing, and a sad facial expression. Man, STAND TALL ! Walk like you own the place. Besides, good posture always makes you look larger. But its not over yet SMILE ! Any change in your physical body makes an immediate, radical change in the way you feel. How you move, use your facial muscles, gesture, walk, talk, and even breathe all determine how you feel in any moment.*  Watch what you eat! What you put into your body deeply affects how you feel emotionally. Changes in your blood sugar, for example, make a radical difference in how you feel emotionally. You are what you eat. Eat well for heavens sake. Pouring sh!t in your body will make you feel like sh!t. Eat live foods and youll feel alive. If you arent paying attention to what youre eating, youre going to pay an emotional price.*  Listen to yourself.  You're the only person who knows what's right for you. Don't put others' opinions above your own inner voice.* Stop putting yourself down, and quit incessantly confessing your tiny flaws. Say no to negativity. Learn to highlight your positive attributes and stop whining like a little girl. *  Get in touch with your dreams and ambitions. Reach for the sky. Passion is confidence. ------------------Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.- Roosevelt"Did I hear the phrase "she already has a bf"?

    The real deal on confidence towards women! 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Alright, let's make this short and straight to the point(this is probably a wake up call to most of you people)...Success with women has little to do with how you act and feel about them, but have a lot to do with how you feel about yourself. What Im talking about is SELF-RESPECT. Some of the guys who wouldn't take crap from another guy turn into down-right wimps when it comes to women. They are probably reliving old dramas with their mommies they couldn't please as children, or are scared for some other reason, they put the woman first.  Other guys have a different problem. They may not take any crap from the woman, but getting laid is too damn important to them that they lose sight of other priorities. In a sense it loses all the fun aspects, and gets to be a damn obligation. Guys like this may win the battles, but they are definitely losing the war. Women are nice additions to your life, and if you find the right one then kudos, you might even chose to make her the center of yours. BUT A LIFE SPENT DOING NOTHING BUT TRYING TO GET WOMEN IS A DAMN POINTLESS ONE. This is problem that people often overlook, ask yourself if you might be missing some of the other pleasures life has to offer. You might be shocked to learn that other things can be more stimulating than a boring date with a huge breasted bimbo that cant even spell her own name. Here is an important aspect to raising your  confidence with women: STOP NEEDING THEM SO MUCH! Find yourself an exciting hobby(not jerking off), go out and have fun without the constraints and presence of women  women are not and should not be the center of your universe. Do something that gets you AWAY from women. This will increase your confidence as you are on the lookout for them, it also provides a great escape for when that special woman strains your brain, which by the way, they often will.

Start Thinking Right and You'll Succeed with Women Beyond Your Wildest Dreams The man who is successful with women thinks in terms of 100% success at all times.  While the guy who fails with women thinks in terms of failure most of the time. Perhaps, in your case, you've been having a hard time meeting, dating or seducing girls (or all three) because you subconsciously expect to have a hard time!  When you try to meet a girl, you fail.  Why? Because you subconsciously expect to fail.  When you ask a girl for a date, you get turned down.  Why?  Because you subconsciously expect to get turned down.  And it's the same story all the way into the bedroom. Women easily sense this lack of confidence in you and react accordingly.  Actually, you are beaten before you even start! So, guys it's time to change your attitude.  Think positive and expect to succeed with every woman you meet or approach.  It will make a world of difference in your love life. 2) AVOID FALLING INTO THIS RUT WHICH CAN PREVENT YOU FROM MEETING SINGLE WOMEN.  Most men are defeated by ego-deflating imaginations before they have even begun: The fear that you will not be liked, that you haven't a chance, that it's no use even trying because "she" could never possibly go for you are your chief, self-imposed obstacles.  You use your imagination to erect barriers and obstacles rather than help your cause! Don Diebel------------------"Women.

    <h3>
    The Ultimate Don Juan: ME! 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Apart from a one of silly "mistake" this weekend I feel I have now become the "Ultimate Don Juan"It is all in the attitude.Not JERKNot NICE GUYand not even NICE JERKI am the CARING GUY WHO TAKES NO SH!T.Boy does that work well!Okay,CARING:This is something that all girls need. They need their guy to CARE about them, they need to FEEL loved. This is your job, and it shouldn't be too hard after spending an hour or two on here really.If a girl thinks you don't care about her then she will not feel welcome, she will not feel right around you.TAKES NO SH!TOkay, this is what most people don't do or understand, this is where you COMMAND respect from a girl and where you LEARN about her the most.Here you need to learn that ANY sign of disrespect is bad, and should be dealt with RIGHT AWAY BEFORE it gets worse.If she thinks she can do this once, and get away, whats to stop her from doing it again? Disrespect is like a weed. -Something small that just gets on your nerves, but if you leave it alone it will soon become a problem that you will find hard to control.NEVER EVER let disrespect grow in your garden! -It's the sure root to bad times and eventually the dumping ground.Okay, next time she is trying to make you jealous by talking about some guy that she is "just going to lunch" with say something like this:"Listen, if I EVER thought you were upto ANYTHING with ANYONE else your ass would be outta here so fast it wouldn't even touch the floor on the way out."Then just leave it at that. (Say NOTHING else) -She has been put in her place.-She knows your annoyed with what she does-She knows you won't tolerate her annoying you-She thinks she isn't as secure as she first thought she was! (time for her to hit the drawing board again)All this while you sit preety knowing she is putting in all this effort for you!  I'm just sooo good I wish I could eat myself up!Try it, learn it well and you will NEVER again have problems in a relationship.  ------------------*Hidden-Danjer*Stand back people I am in love with myself!

    Set yourself apart from others 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Finally got permission to post this:TIP #1 - Single women go on dates to have a good time, not to be serious. Keep this in mind and never act serious on the first few dates. If you try to get serious, sexual, and romantic too soon, you will only drive women away. TIP #2 - Add imagination and romance to your dates. Do things slightly different than the norm. Instead of just having dinner at your place, have a candlelit dinner with fresh flowers on the table. Go to see classic films. Spend an afternoon at the museum. In other words, try to set yourself apart from all of the other guys. It's easy to tell what she is used to doing on dates - out to a movie, to dinner, to a party. So avoid the same old thing, or add a slight variation to what she is used to. She will remember it. TIP #3 - End the date before she does. When you first start dating, it is important to avoid that awkward time when it is getting late and she finally has to announce that it is time for her to go home. When the evening is still going well and still on an "up note," announce that you "...hate to end the evening because you've had such a great time, but it is getting late and..." This is going to surprise her because most guys hang on until the bitter end hoping that by some miracle they will end up in bed for some hot passionate sex with her. By ending the date before she does, you: 1. Set yourself apart from other guys. 2. Continue to maintain control over her and the evening. 3. Make yourself hard to get. 4. Suggest that you aren't desperate for action, therefore there must be other single girls in your life and she is going to have to work harder to catch you. P.S.

    KILL THE NERVOUS, NEEDY WRECK 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Walking down the street, you notice that a Gisele Bundchen several hundred feet away seem to stare at you, possibly even smile. Do you approach her? How? What do you say? All these questions are screaming in your mind.I know what you are thinking : "Wow, this is probably my future wife !" or "I want to talk to her, and maybe even get her number." But when the time comes to actually speak to her, you can't say anything because you're too scared of rejection. Your tongue gets tied, and you can't think of what to say. Then the two of you go your separate ways, and you never see her again, you moron. What a wasted opportunity. You could have started a casual conversation, and invited her to have a drink with you. Your destiny might have been linked through a simple hello. Instead, you are left cursing yourself. You stupid idiot, another wasted opportunity. Next time, I'll be ready and I won't back down. Of course when the next time arrives, you act the same way as the previous oneOne of the reasons why some men have such a hard time meeting women, is because of the view they have about approaching them. The problem is that men think that they need the perfect sales pitch or pick-up line to either get women into bed, or marry them. This is a big order to fill, and the odds of accomplishing such a task (for the average man), are virtually impossible. So most men choose to stay silent instead of approaching women, and avoid rejection all together.When approaching a woman, keep it simple, and keep your expectations low. You're not going through a job interview; you're not meeting her parents; and your definitely not getting married. What you are doing, is making a friend, and nothing more. If you think this way, it'll be a lot easier to approach a woman. Forget about meeting a lover. Concentrate on making a friend first, the lover role will soon follow. But if you think that you need to seduce her from the outset, you'll only make it harder for you to approach her.If you keep in mind that you're just trying to socialize with a stranger, you'll have the courage. Just tell yourself, I'm going to have a pleasant conversation with the woman standing beside me. I'm looking for nothing but a few minutes of pleasant conversation. I'm not looking for a date, a kiss, a lover, or a wife. Dont be fooled, flirting is not a relationship. It is easy to create a mental relationship that in reality has no existence. It was just flirting and thats all. You need to understand that nine out of women people who you flirt with are just flirting and that is the way you should be too.Flirting should be fun. There should be many chicks you just flirt with and not go beyond that. So until a flirtation changes into an actual date, it is nothing but a flirtation. Even if you are not totally interested in the girl, you are still going to enjoy the flirtation and then let go. Being single does not mean that you stay home and brood. Get out there. Go to parties, eat at new restaurants, and get your life off hold. Plus, I have found that when you get your life off hold, life begins to sweep in and meet you at the very point that you extend yourself into it.------------------Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.- Roosevelt[This message has been edited by CHALENGE GUY (edited 05-06-2001).]

    <h3>
    Why Self
    </h3>
    <p>
    


How many of you DJs study this web site? I mean REALLY study it? As in, using the search option and researching the archives when you need advice? Well, I have...and Ive noticed something.There are plenty of redundant posts concerning Confidence and Technique. However, not too many folks talk about Self-Respect on this discussion board. Yet Im convinced that it is THE issue that gets to bottom of most of our problems with women. There are five main terms Im going to mention that Ive list in order of importance:- Self-Respect- Self-Improvement- Character- Personality- Confidence- TechniqueWe read a lot of articles on this site and hear a lot from women about how they want a Confident man. How do we show confidence?, we post over and over again. In search of answers, many DJs end up posting various Techniques such as Layguides, NLP, SS, and various dating guidelines, all with purpose of appearing confident and in control. Other DJs feel that Techniques arent necessarily  a sure fire way to solving your confidence problem, hence Pooks brilliant Be a Man! article. I, however, believe there is room for both schools of thought.Heres my take on it. Confidence is a Personality trait.  Anyone can fake confidence.  However, we know all too well that most women can see through that. No SS pattern will work on any woman if your Self-Confidence is shallow. Pook was dead on when he implied that theres more to Confidence than memorizing Techniques. In his best-selling book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Stephen Covey stressed the crucial differences between Personality and Character. Covey explains that Personality is indicated by ones communication skills, or by what a person says and does  in public. Character is indicated by ones behavior independent of any interpersonal relationships. More simply, Character is what you do when no one else is watching. This presents a serious problem, especially for mature DJs like myself who want LTRs. If we only use Techniques to become successful with women, we run the risk of becoming men with great Personalities and social skills but with little strength of  Character. On the other hand, if we have Character strength both no social skills, were no better off.The best solution we have is to take time to develop a Self-Improvement program that develops both our Character and Personality.  Both must coincide, be congruent and compatible in order for our Techniques to be effective. The very first step towards becoming a successful "Don Juan" is one of self-improvementBy focusing on a program of continual self-improvement you'll evolve into an attractor. Your strategy is always to think about, focus on, and accentuate your positive traits... but work on and eliminate your flaws.  -Allen ThompsonAllen is right. Self-Improvement is the very first step. But I can say from experience that it is also the most difficult step. The problem is that most of us place way too much emphasis on getting a girlfriend. Then we really mess up by using women as a motivating factor in improving ourselves. This by far is the biggest and most common mistake we make as DJs. As soon as we run into some setbacks, miss a workout, get used and/or rejected a few times by women, were quick to just give up and crawl back into our comfortable shells.Enter SELF-RESPECT! The late great DJ Legend Adonis said it best in one of the earliest articles concerning self-respect:Success with women has little to do with how you act and feel about them, but have a lot to do with how you feel about yourself. What Im talking about is SELF-RESPECT. Some of the guys who wouldn't take crap from another guy turn into down-right wimps when it comes to women. Women are nice additions to your life, . BUT A LIFE SPENT DOING NOTHING BUT TRYING TO GET WOMEN IS A DAMN POINTLESS ONE.  - Adonis Yes, there is a reason to improve yourself other than to attract women. When you respect yourself, peoples insults and womens rejections dont phase you, because youre not doing it for them. You are working hard to become a Don Juan because dammit you deserve it! You are doing it for YOU. Not her, YOU! You will never insult yourself. You will never reject yourself. Therefore you will always improve and wont always back down. And one doesnt improve in order to get self-respect. One improves because of self-respect. Self-Respect isnt attained or developed. It is already inside you.You know, I used to wonder why I worked so hard to improve my appearance.  Here I am, 57, skinny, will never be muscular, will never be tall, will never be what women find physically attractive. Why do I even try? I dont have a girlfriend. I dont have anyone special to impress. Then I thought about it and realized that I do have someone special to impress..His name is Survivor.That, my fellow DJs, is SELF-RESPECT.

    <h3>
    The Perfect Don Juan 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


THE PERFECT DON JUAN             He asks for a girl's phone     number when he FIRST meets or  sees her. Not one month later.He always asks for the HOME    phone number. He walks away if he doesn't get it. A Don Juan always waits four   or more days before calling a  girl. She must wait.A Don Juan never arranges a    date face-to-face with a girl. He always calls first. She     must wait and wonder about him.He sees a girl ONLY once a week for the first three weeks. He has to 'clear' his dates with other women. Or pretend he is busy with other  women. He says he is busy if   she wants more.A Don Juan never gives flowers, cards, or gifts for   the first two months. Her      birthday is the only exception .He never talks over an hour    with a women on the phone. EVER. Twenty minutes is tops. He avoids contact with her. With e-mails and messages, etc. between dates. He calls once to arrange the next date.During the first three months  he tells her NOTHING about     himself. She has to ask. When  asked, he gives only tiny      itty bitty pieces.He waits for her to say 'I love you' first. Then he knows she really means it.A Don Juan never says 'I love  you' before two months. Ever.A Don Juan NEVER proposes      before six months. He prefers to wait one year. All minor    flaws must be seen.A Don Juan never lives with a  women. He is a free man. He    will marry the BEST when he    meets her. A Don Juan only FOCUSES on the romantic side of a women. He   knows long talks lead to       friendship not LOVE. He knows  being a mystery fascinates her and makes her WONDER and WANT him.And lastly, a true Don Juan   makes sure the relationship    is 50-50. HALF of the time     she is doing what HE wants to  do. He feels this in his       stomach. Not head.AD

    Wake Up Call !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Recently, I've noticed there have been a number of posts that sound similar to this:I've been dating/seeing/pursuing this girl and she did *(WHATEVER)* to me. What should I do to get her to like me [again]? ORI've been admiring/checking out/liking this one girl for *(SOME IRRELEVANT AMOUNT OF TIME)* and she looked at me. What should I do?Guys do me and the other DJ's a huge favor andWAKE THE F*CK UP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!1. A true DJ doesn't worry or fret over petty and frivalous things like the look a girl gave you or the way she covers her mouth. He's busy improving himself and adding chicks to his list.2. If a chick sparks your interest don't sit there like a dumb a$$ dog wondering what to do... GO GET IT !3. IF THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAYDJ's don't sit there pondering over the fact that some chick didn't call. In the mean time they are busy doing something else (or someone else for that matter!).4. We all need to remember that we are each only in control of ourselves. Although you can influence a chick's actions you can't control the way she will act, think, or respond. So quit worrying about it. It's beyond your control.5. We also need to remember ourselves. Part of being a DJ is took achieve an overall self improvement. As men we should never apologize for our actions. We should go full-speed ahead and confidently into each and every action we choose to take. Success or failure is all in the evaluation. Every experience has it's lesson. Learn it and move on.6. Learn to let go! A woman knows when a man will not let go. Some will take advantage of this. As a true DJ you have to be willing to cut a girl loose in a second if she crosses the line. And let her know.7. Remember to be the man. In any given situation you should take as much charge as you can. Also learn not dwell on mistakes. Keep your cool at all times. Don't let some female get you all confused and mixed up! Have an objective and persue it.So guys quit squandering your precious time and energy away on counter productive pursuits and those "friendships" you are involved in. Start respecting yourself and demanding the respect that you are entitled to. Wake Up! ------------------ quote: "Even though we suffer losses, I count the victories." - Talib Kweli

    <h3>
    The Last Laugh 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Here's another way to think about rejection by a woman.The other night I went out with a girl, a week later I was (you guessed it) rejected.  It didn't really bother me too much because I knew I had learned from it.  Anyway, I got home and was listening to music and a song called 'The Last Laugh.' came on.  This got me to thinking about my experience and it hit me that this is a perfect attitude to have.I am assuming that if you are reading tips from this site then you are trying to improve yourself (or giving advice).  Obviously, when a girl rejects you, you will not become part of her life and you miss out on the relationship.  So why do you have the last laugh?For a number of reasons:1.  She is missing the company of a great guy and thinks that she is making the right choice.2.  You are improving yourself, so in the future, you will be even more of a catch.  Ironically, it may turn out that her rejection of you is even more incentive to make yourself a better person (to become a better person I just mean try new things, build confidence, learn about people, etc.), if she had accepted you, you would have less time to carry out activities you want to do and may become complacent in your efforts of self-improvement.  Therefore she is missing out on the great person you are and the greater person you will be (a greater person that she may have helped develop, in an indirect way).  You maintain the freedom of bachelorhood, the desire to keep on moving ahead in life and the choice of more women who can appreciate you.Why wouldn't you be laughing?

    Laziness = Masturbation 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Since today is Labor Day, I think a few words might be in order regarding the pathetic lack of effort some of you (and you know who you are) are guilty of where it concerns meeting new women.You say you want to meet girls. OK. But how hard do you try? I mean REALLY try? I believe some of you approach maybe 1-2 girls a month, get blown off, get discouraged, go home and pout about it, then beat your meat. Do you honestly expect any success by being so lazy?People that are good at things are dedicated to being the best. They're constantly looking for improvements. Take Tiger Woods.......Do you think he just got up one day and discovered that he had a great golf swing? Not hardly! The kid eats, drinks, and sleeps golf. He hits over a thousand balls a day in practice. His dedication has paid off.....He's the best there is! Eddie Van Halen once told someone that he went to bed with his guitar so he could start playing it as soon as he woke up.....I could go on and on, but I think you get the drift......Meeting women is no different, it takes work, dedication, and patience to get results. Most of you don't want to disrupt your "balance".....You get up, go to work/school, come home, get on the PC or watch TV, eat some dinner, go for a stroll at a mall, never approach anybody, go back home, get a shower, then go to bed with Miss Rosey Palm.Does this sound like you? If so, then don't b*tch about being so alone. It's your own fault!There was a time during my twenties when I approached over ONE HUNDRED women a month! I didn't spend my spare time doing nothing....I wouldn't go to one store a day, I'd go to thirty! I loved it! Every second of it! Hell, even getting blown off was fun....I'd get with my buddies later and swap "war stories" with 'em. We'd laugh our @sses off!I loved going out with/banging multiple chicks at the same time. I think all young guys should. When I met my (future) wife I was seeing something like six different girls!Unless you live in some remote wilderness, you have no excuse......Available women aren't going to come to your door, you have to get out there and find them!Remember guys, someday a nursing home attendant is going to have to help you get up to take a piss.......Go have a blast while you're young!!Best Wishes>>BJB

    <h3>
    To Be a True Don Juan 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


While I'm posting my thoughts...To me, there are a few defining, fundamental characteristics that a true Don Juan must possess.  If you can attain these traits, then you can achieve anything.  Essentially, the things that I am going to list can be seen as building blocks to something greater, they are useful and necessary in themselves, but what you can achieve with building upon them...Firstly, being a Don Juan is not about memorizing lines, the 'rules' of when to call, when to compliment, etc.  It is about the right attitude and frame of mind.  It is about having confidence in everything you do, understanding people and succeeding (eventually) in all you do.  So, what characteristics do I see as fundamental? Patience, perserverence and confidence.1. Patience.  Patience is important quite simply because everything takes time.  If you are learning a new skill (e.g. 'Don Juaning') then it will take time to learn, you cannot expect results overnight.  If you do expect immediate results, you will quit when you don't get them.  Also, when dealing with women, impatience might be interpreted as desperation or pushiness under certain circumstances.  Therefore, maintain a calm demeanor through great patience and you will succeed.How do you build patience?  Recognise impatient thoughts and cut them off.  When you are waiting in line, don't tap your fingers and check your watch every two minutes, realise that you will have to wait and accept it.  Enjoy the scenery, talk to people around you and think about things.  Basically, work on enjoying every minute of life, even if you are not doing something that you like.  You just have to control your thoughts and not dwell on a situation (e.g. waiting) that you cannot change.2. Perserverence - this is closely related to patience and is the most important step on your way to building confidence.  What advice comes up again and again in these posts?  Practice.  Try again and again until you succeed, get back up after failing and give it another go.  Plain old stubborness will get you where you want to go.  Eventually.  As you can see, patience is an integral part of perserverence, so work on the patience and the perserverence together.  The only advice I can give for perserverence is to not let failure get to you, know that if you keep trying, you will succeed.  Learn from failure, but don't consider it a failure, at least you tried.3. Confidence.  This is the big one.  However, to gain the confidence necessary to succeed, you will need to practice and not get discouraged.  You will have to work with your own shortcomings and the differences in people around you.  You must be prepared to take risks and fail sometimes.  Essentially, you need to have great patience and perserverence in everything you do.Confidence comes from practice, it is as simple as that.  There are other techniques to help out, but nothing subsitutes getting your hands dirty in the real world.Once you have become a master at maintaining these elements, then you can work on all of the techniques listed on this site (or make up your own).Another couple of things that are important in building up these characteristics is being able to make reasonable goals and taking small steps towards these goals.  Goals are important because they give you something clear to work towards.  They must be reasonable; if they are too low, you are not challenging yourself or making progress; if they are too high, you may become discouraged as you cannot achieve them; they must be specific, something you can solidly achieve.  In this way, you can take small steps that, when put together, take you to where you want to go.  Don't expect to go from beginner Don Juan to expert Don Juan overnight.  Take small steps like smiling at every woman before attempting to take every woman home.Anyway, these are what I consider the building blocks to a successful love life and a successful life.  They are all linked together.  Incorporate these traits into your personality and you cannot possibly fail!

    <h3>
    Offensive vs defensive plays 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


So... you see a hottie, you make a move, you get the digits, things are going great. But wait just a minute. What's really happening here? You're doing the DJ thing because you know there are hundreds of other guys out there - and that means you have to look right, act right, smell right, think right, and have your life right. Otherwise chicks won't like you, and that's bad - right?Wrong. 110% wrong. This how the AFCs see it -they wonder and sweat if they are truly worthy of that hottie they see before them. They fear they will make a mistake, and the world will end. They are terrified that rejection will happen, and this will confirm their lowly sub-human status. They feel that *if only* they had more something - looks, charm, money, shirts, shorts, hair, whatever - that they would then meet this woman's standards. And then they would be cool. And all of that. This is the defensive play position. And it's one of the ultimate evils in DJ land. Think for a moment how screwy it is. First off, it gives the woman all the power. If she disses you, you're crushed. You creep away and cry. You make love to your hand. Life is a sad and grey place. And it's all her fault... (As if!)Secondly there's no confidence in it. And no - that's not confidence because 'confidence gets the babes'. That's confidence for knowing that that's who you are - a man, and totally proud of it. And finally, chicks love to play this game. Someone posted an example recently of a chicking coming right out and asking 'So why should I think you're special compared to all the other guys who want me?'Not all chicks say this, but a lot of them can think it. And once you let her play that game, you're on the spot - sweating and thinking 'What do I say? What do I do? Am I doing this right? Oh no! That wasn't right. That wasn't funny enough. I just crapped out...'Well, fvck that. Here's a huge DJ secret - as soon as you catch yourself thinking like that, stop and pause. Watch what you're doing to yourself. And kill it dead. Because it's BS. The offensive position is *not to care what the chick thinks.* Not at all. Not even if she's that ultimate perfect 10, with a personality to match. Can you do that? Yes you can. You have to remember one key thing - you live DJ-style not to 'pick up chicks' to prove anything to anyone. Not you, not her, not your mother or God or the guy who beat the crap out of you in sixth grade. You do it because it leads to fun and makes your life a better place to be. And that is the *only* reason you do it. It's about *you*. Not her. Not anyone else. *You.*But there's more. Now that we've worked out where the real priorities should be, you can start to do pickups not to wheedle and manipulate otherwise disinterested women so you can get laid, but to find women who are worthy of your time and attention - first with the looks, and then with the personality. The whole package. One night. LTR. Long term dating. Whatever *you* want. You don't approach women hoping that if you do and say all the right things in the right order standing exactly so and giving all the right signals, she might - if you're really lucky - condescend to spend time with you. You do the approach to *check her out.* You know she's cute, and now you want to know more. You want to know if she's good enough to add something good to your life. (Or is she just another bratty self-centred biatch who thinks she's the **** but is really nothing special at all?) Is she funny? Is she cool? Is she smart? Is she sane? Is she really as cute close up? These are the only questions that matter. You'll notice 'Am I doing this right?' is not one of them. So you do approaches because *you are the man.* You are looking for quality. You are testing for quality. You are not putting yourself on the spot to see if she decides you are the weakest link. You are approaching her to see what *she can do for you*. Why does this work? First off it puts her on the defensive. Instead of fawning and supplicating all over her like the average nervous AFC, she sees right away you can take her (heh...  ) or leave her. This blows a fuse in the chick mind. Once you're the real deal, you'll find she starts doing things to impress you, rather than the other way round. This is a good place for you to be.  Secondly it means you don't care about the outcome, so you get to be more relaxed. If she blows you off - well, so what? Chicks that aren't quality can't spot quality when they see it. This is not your problem. If she's having a mood or something - again, not your problem. It's not your job to work out what's up with her. And because you have no problems with the approach, you can find yourself a 'next' with no worries. But the real killer principle is - this isn't about chicks. This is about you. If you want quality, you have to decide to *be* quality. But forget some kind of work ethic or money crap. Quality doesn't mean owning a beamer and a $10,000,000 house in Palo Alto. Quality means belonging to the aristocracy of those who live life on their own terms, doing what they enjoy the most. If that means money, then go make money. If that means something else, then go do something else. But - again - you do it for you. Because it improves your life and makes you happier. And when you do it, you do it for everything. The whole chick thing is just a fun sideline.

    What is she trying to tell me?...Don't worry about it.

This weekend I hada chance to go to our new chatroom and talk for a while with one of our younger DJs. We were the only ones on and he asked me for some advice about a girl from his high school. As he explained the situation I started to feel a little sad for him. You see he was going on and on about every little thing this girl had done and said over the last couple of months.Well, until not too many months ago I used to do that sort of thing myself. I know the feeling of obsessing about what a girl is trying to tell you:Is she just being nice? Does she REALLY like me and I'm missing some sort of sign that's obvious to everyone else? Should I ask her out? Should I back off for a while and see if she pursues me? What should I do?There is a post going around tips right now that reminds me of this sad state of mind. In it, a DJ is trying to be helpful telling us to pay close attention to a woman's actions for clues to what we are or aren't doing wrong. It's as if the woman is some sort of superior being whose needs and desires we ought to be trying to figure out and satisfy before she even asks. It is our task to go around saying 'Hmmm... what does her highness want today? Is she happy, or not. If not why not. Is it something I did? Is it something I didn't do? What if shes trying to tell me something I'm doing that is pissing her off and I'm just not geting it. OMG, what if she's getting ready to LEAVE me and I'm so dense I can't even see there is a problem?Of course this is a one-way deal. If we want something WE have to ASK her for it. No going around wondering what her man might be thinking or feeling. No. If he has a problem with something he better just spit it out. And then the woman can either CHOOSE to try and do something to help the situation, OR she can just try to make him feel guilty for daring to suggest that something she is doing may be less-than-perfect.This guy I was chatting with was already doing this with a girl... and they weren't even going out together. already he felt the need for clarification of her intentions, he felt romantic desire for her, he felt like knowing what she was thinking...But those needs, reasonable though they are, he is allowing to go totally unmet. Why? Because he thinks that if he trys to kiss this girl, or tells her he wants to get with her, it might make her think she was doing something to lead him on when she wasn't, or make her uncomfortable. Her ANTICIPATED needs and desires, over-rule his real ones. Sad. Very sad.The girl had been really flirting hardcore with this guy. She already has a boyfriend, but that isn't stopping her I guess. He wanted my advice on how to handle her. I told him you have to make a move on her. next time she is getting touchy with you, kiss her on the lips. If she doesn't let you, then you say 'What's the problem? You've been all over me like white on rice for months now. I think you owe me an explaination.'If she says anything other than 'ok, you're right, I was just surprised that's all' and lets you have that kiss, then you totally cut her off. No more of your attention goes her way. Period. Make sure when she is around that you are polite with her but distant, and always pay mor attention to the other girls around.He sat there a minute then said:'Dude. You have just told me exactly the right thing to do. and I know I'm not going to do it.'I told him not to worry about it. and that really is my advice. Especially if its some girl giving you mixed signals. Just make your move. you will know instantly whether she was really interested or just bull****ting. then you don't have to wonder anymore. You owe it to yourself guys. don't obsess over what some chick wants. If shes mad tell her that you don't know what she's mad about but you think she ought to go home, cool down, and call you later to talk it over. but be firm that you are not going to let her 'punish' you by staying around you acting *****y cause she's in a snit.what if she leaves? big deal. Plenty more good ass where she came from. This is not being a jerk either. this is just being a strong, confident, honest man. It's also expecting to be dealt with in an honest way by any chick that you are considering allowing into your life in a major way.Ok, I'm done preaching now. like Dr. Laura says: 'Now go do the RIGHT thing!'

    The Inner Struggle of the DJ Student 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


AFC's are men who are fundamentally ignorant of both the mentality required to succeed with women and the attitude which their behaveior reflects.  AFCs who begin to understand the defects in their attitudes (but do not yet completely) focus primarily on the behaviors that they think will get them where they need to be with women.They are told that they need not to look towards women for validation in their life yet they continue to be discouraged and sometimes even depressed over the failures of their early attempts at DJing and they allow rejections to strike them at the very core of their ego.  They are told to be a challenge and to not put women on a pedastal and yet they break down to AFC behaviors after the first few interactions or dates with a woman allowing their prospects to be aware of their feelings and end up posting here telling us they have met the girl of their dreams with whom they want to have an LTR.  Sometimes they will even go so far as to post questions like "how do I appear as a challege?"  The fact that this question is even being asked implies that the person asking it is not a challenge at all otherwise they would not be asking, they are merely attempting unsuccessfully to mask their AFC attitudes with behaviors they've learned with the hopes that that will get them through a seduction.Attempts to hide attitudes behind behaviors will always fail because behavior in the end will always reflect true attitudes.  An AFC who is on a date concerned about whether or not he's doing or saying the right thing, not able to stand to keep his eagerness from influencing his actions and scared to death that the woman might reject him and he'll be left lonely as he's always been is nervous and visibly so to the woman.  Under these conditions, how can he possibly be expected to maintain his DJ composure as he throws off those slick little neg-hits he read in the tips forum earlier that afternoon?Little does this guy realize that the root cause of his problem is his attitude.  All he knows are tips and techniques that come across horribly if the person using them is not confident, indecisive and has their self-worth and ego joined at the hip with the outcome of the evening.If the guy I just described is you, you don't have to tell us, but man be honest with yourself!  You've been told not to be desparate.  Are you desparate?  Don't post your answer, just ask yourself.Becoming a DJ is a long process that develops with experiences over time.  Rejection is a stepping stone to success but only if you understand the mistakes you are making and make up your mind not to make those mistakes again.  With this attitude how could you not end up a great DJ?  And that being the case, what excuse do you have for fear of rejection when you know you will be successful in long run for a fact?  Success breeds success and as you have more and more positive experiences behind you, you'll be more and more unstoppable.It's not always easy.  The question about life is never "is there going to be adversity in your endeavors?", but rather "what will you do when you run into it?"  Are you going to be an AFC and give up?  Are you going to post here about how much life sucks and how you're a pathetic loser who can't get chicks?  You certainly can, but you're not going to like my reply.  Or are you going to be honest with yourself about how you screwed up and what you need to change and go find another chick to not do the same thing with?Unfortunately, nobody on this board can post anything that is going to give you the true confidence that is going allow you to embrace wholeheartedly the attitude that you need to be successful with women,  you have to find it in yourself.  We can't go there, we can only point the way.  Until you find it, you're not there yet, you're just another guy with "Master Don Juan" under his name.------------------You either own the game or it owns you![This message has been edited by trickynick (edited 03-21-2002).]

As a reader of this web site, I assume you want to have your pick of attractive women for sex, a relationship, or both.  If that is truly one of the things you want, why havent achieved your goal?  Why do you continuously fail, and each time question your abilities or even your self-worth as a person?If you truly wish to succeed with women, you cant rely on what you already know.  Because in reality, you know little or nothing that is of any use.  You must throw away the past, even if you enjoyed marginal success.  You may not realize it, but such success was accidental.  Put simply, you got lucky.  However, succeeding with women has nothing to do with luck, but everything to do with skill.But how do you become skilled enough to succeed?  Success doesnt come from simply studying the theoretical principles of being a DJ.  If doing so was enough, everyone who reads this site would never need to come back.  But youre back again and again, still unable to achieve success with women.  What you need to understand is that all of the DJ philosophies in the world will be useless unless you prepare yourself both physically and mentally to be able to put them into practice.  Put another way, you need to maximize your physical appearance and become educated about things in which beautiful women would be interested.Take a look at yourself in the mirror.  Take a good long look.  Look closely at your body.  If you were a beautiful woman, would you sleep with the guy in the mirror?  Chances are the answer is no.  Likewise, think about what you know, namely, do you have a command of current events, modern and classical literature, or anything that would be of interest to a beautiful woman.  If you were a beautiful woman, would you want to have a long talk with you over a candlelight dinner or before a roaring fireplace?  Chances are again the answer is no.You cannot become that which you desire unless you are willing to pay the price to set yourself up for success.  How much are you willing to pay?[This message has been edited by Sting (edited 02-03-2002).]

    <h3>
    How to Eliminate Desire 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


So what makes a person an AFC?  Is his style?  Is it his looks?  Is it the things he says? No.  What makes an AFC is himself.  More specifically, it is his internal scripts or mind set that makes him the way he is.The AFC's internal scripts are varied and mostly jumbled.  But there are usually three main components to them that I will discuss each in turn.  Personalizing everything A chump has the tendency to over analyze everything and worry about saying the right thing or the wrong thing, interpreting any negative response from a woman as his doing and so on.  By putting such an emphasis on the me the AFC places himself at the center of the situation and finds himself having to react and question every single little thing.  He is so worried of screwing up he overwhelms himself because he thinks he must do everything right in order to get anywhere with the particular lady.Believing that things will stay the sameAn AFC takes rejection badly and thinks that because one woman rejected him, they all will reject him.  Even though he may at one point think he has a legitimate chance, he becomes so worried because of the past experience that he short circuits himself and fulfils his self-proclaimed prophecy which just reinforces his erroneous belief.Attributing failure with women as a failure in lifeThe AFC has the tendency to put such an emphasis on woman that she becomes the all-being consuming focus in his life.  When failure occurs with a particular woman he believes that his failure in dating (just one area of his life) means he is a failure in his entire life.  Such thinking leads him to overwhelm himself with a total feeling of inadequacy.  With such an erosion of confidence, the chump can hardly get himself to talk to a woman anymore, much less date.In psychology these aspects are referred to as internal (concluding that whatever happens is all your doing), stable (viewing a situation as permanent) and global (believing that what you experience in a given situation affects everything you experience) mental attributions.  Studies have shown that these types of attributions are a recipe for disaster in viewing life in general and are the chief mental characteristics of people who are depressed or prone to depression.To get an idea of the mind set, it as if I walked up to you and told you that in order not to be publicly humiliated in front of the whole world as a looser, you had to perform 800 complicated tasks perfectly with the odds succeeding around 1 in 10,000. Could you be confident in this situation? Could you remain totally calm and controlled? Would you not feel overwhelmed? These internal scripts cause him to be overwhelmed in the presence of women which results in poor actions and behavior that causes him to fail.  While these scripts may be a result of a general outlook to life, these scripts tend to manifest themselves because the chump has such an intense desire to not be alone (to have someone emotionally stimulate him) that he makes the woman out to be something far greater than she is: he puts way too much emphasis and importance in a single woman. To make the situation even worse, a woman can tell a desperate man a mile away. A man who is needy, supplicating and clingy is the ultimate turn off. So what then is the secret of being more successful with women?  The key is to do the opposite of what the chump does.  As Dex in the "Tao of Steve" says: quote: Rule 1 of the Tao of Steve: Eliminate your desires. If your out with a girl and you are thinking of getting laid, you're finished. A woman can smell your agenda. When you interact with a woman and she senses no desire in you, it does a lot of things.  First of all, she will feel more comfortable with you.  Secondly, by her sensing you are not lusting after her, it causes her to become confused as to why you are not lusting after her like every other guy does: it makes you stand out.  By not overtly desiring her, you become a challenge. Because of the affront to her ego, she all of a sudden wonders how she can make you become more attracted to her or at least notice her. Finally, you will more easily have fun and be more fun to be around which will make women respond more positively towards you.So how do you eliminate your desire?  To answer this question, we must understand what desire really is.The essence of desire is wanting things to be other than present experience is.  In otherwords, the AFC is focused more than outcomes rather than focusing on the present moment.  This is the entire key.The AFC, after meeting a woman for the first time, is usually so caught up with her (imagining things like marriage, great sex, how a great person she and so on) he builds a complete fiction of who she is because he desperately wants her to be that special someone. When he finally goes on the date, he worries so much of saying or doing the wrong or right things (concerned with the outcomes of his actions or words) he is rarely even mentally there with the woman at all. Instead of concentrating on finding out who she really is, he acts and prances about under the pretense that he already knows who she is  that special woman. But of course, this special woman is nothing but a self-imposed fiction. Because of his intense desire, his ego becomes inseparably involved in the process and the AFC tries to impress her or put on pretenses so as to tell her that he is better than all the rest of the guys she has been with. This type of act actually psychologically tells the woman that he is in fact insecure because he feels the need to remind her that he is better than all the rest.All a woman really gets from this guy is a nervous, conniving, needy, blabbering fool that appears more occupied in himself than her. Because the guy is not really in tune with her (not really in the moment with her because of his chief concern with the outcome of the date), she senses that the craving is not for her at all but something from her: sex.  Like Dex says, "A women can smell your agenda."The essence of the chumps problem lies in wanting the woman existing in front of him to have a higher interest in him than what the apparent situation presents her interest as.  More simply, the AFC wants the woman to like him so he tries to do things to make her like him. This is a chump in a nutshell.After seeing what desire is, it becomes apparent how to finally eliminate desire.If desire, as I so define it, is wanting things to be other than they are, then the elimination of desire is simply accepting the situation as it truly is, or to put it another way, going with the flow of things in the current situation.  As Dex says, quote:Look at me. Technically, I shouldn't get laid, but I do.  And you know why, Dave?  Because when I'm hanging out with a woman that's all I doing: hanging out, talking, listening, and I'm not sitting there thinking how I can get in bed with them. When you are immersed in the situation and not worrying about the outcome, you concentrate on the situation instead of the outcome of the situation. By so doing you become more fully present in the moment, unlike the chump that mind is elsewhere.As the Buddha stated to a man who wanted a succinct teaching:  quote:In the seeing, there is only the seen. In the hearing, there is only the heard.  In the sensing, there is only the sensed.  In the thinking, there is only the thought.When you are out with a woman, simply be with the woman.  When you are talking to her, simply talk to her.  When you are kissing her, simply kiss her. Get rid of the idea of a date in your mind. Simply think you are going to meet a woman, not a special woman, not a beautiful woman, not a woman who will satisfy your desires, but simply a woman.When you are in the state of just being present in the moment with her, you will naturally exude confidence, control and challenge because you are not trying to be anything and you are not trying to achieve anything.  The confident man doesn't even think of confidence, he simply is.  The controlled man appears naturally in control because being in control is not an issue for him.  Finally, the man who is a challenge is not needy because he doesn't need the woman; he derives his pleasure from situations with a woman and not the woman itself.This type of state, where a person is fully present, is what Dex refers to as "being Steve."  Everyone has experienced being in the "flow" or peak states where tasks appear to be done effortlessly.  Dating is no exception.Whereas the chump goes ahead and tries to force things to happen, the Don Juan allows things to happen.  In a true Taoist fashion, it is when we are trying the least that we achieve the most success.Most importantly, when you are "being Steve" you are naturally having fun.  If you are dating and not having any fun, you are simply not dating.Above all else a woman loves a man who naturally appears to have his act together and is fun to be with.  Such a man, for all intensive purposes, is free and is loving and living life.  And when you are simply enjoying the moment, a woman will want to enjoy it with you.Enjoy life with or without women and simply be.[This message has been edited by DarkDream (edited 02-21-2002).]

    <h3>
    The Holy Grail of Dating 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


I was reading an article by Doc Love on "Why Is That Babe with Such a Loser?" which triggered a lightning bolt series of thoughts that culminated into a series of very shocking insights that left me at times almost disgusted in what I had discovered.  I had found the holy grail of the dating world: the mind-set of the true master Don Juan. A mind set that would cause extremely beautiful woman fall crazy in love with you to the point they would do anything for you.  Pook and WildThang had hit upon it, but only in a circuitous fashion.  I had found the heart of it.The following work is an essay, if you will, it is long but well worth the read.  All those who read this, take it in and ruminate on it will greatly benefit. Any truly good Don Juan advice and theory will be a mere echo from these pages.  I fully began to comprehend that the mating dance was nothing but trying to get the most powerful mate possible.  I turned to evolutionary psychology to help me fully describe what a powerful mate was.  A powerful mate was simply a mate that was able to survive, reach sexual maturity and produce viable offspring better than other individuals. Power was simply equated with the increased ability to pass on the "selfish genes" each one of us harbors.  Through the course of evolution, those traits or characteristics that over time proved them selves to lead to the greater proliferation of those genes (that caused the traits in the first place) began to be selected with greater frequency by a genetic counterpart.  Those genetic counterparts who were able to respond to these traits and mate with such individuals ended up passing on their own genes (the genes that were able to identify the "attractive traits" in the first place).  Those individuals who possessed the more powerful genes and were able to identify those more powerful genes in others and mate with them ended up balancing the gene pool in their favor at the expense of the other less powerful genes.  In the course of time, both male and females began to be "hard coded" with genes that would lead the sexes to fairly universally desire certain characteristics and traits that over the course of evolution proved to be features, that once mated with, greatly increased the chances of passing on one's own genes.Now what are these key characteristics that men and woman find attractive in one another?For men it is simply the woman's body.  The perfect "10" female is a "genetic celebrity" as Doc Love adequately put it in his article mentioned above.  Such a woman wields tremendous power.  The human body contains a wealth of information on the health and potential reproductive success of the individual.  Such beautiful woman are attractive to males because over the course of evolution the males who found these females attractive and mated with them produced more healthy and viable offspring because of their genetic make up. For example, it is a scientific fact that woman with certain waist and hip dimensions can produce more children than woman with other waist and hip dimensions.For woman, the man's body did not matter as much as the woman's body did for the man. The woman's role in those early hunter-gatherer days was simply to gather food, bear and look after the children.  Because of the incapacity of pregnancy and the difficulty of throwing a weapon at prey with a baby in the arms, the woman relied on the man to literally bring home the bacon.  The woman became the instrument of bringing new life in the world while the man's role was simply to provide for the woman and the new offspring.  While a healthy, genetically sound body was essential for a good hunter and healthy offspring, there were other important characteristics that clearly separated one successful hunter from another.      To be a successful hunter, the individual had to be controlled and patient.  They had to have the ability to know when to strike and do so with force and conviction.  They also had to be brave and not psychologically deficient.  Those individuals that usually excelled at the hunt (due in large part of these characteristics) became natural leaders and usually got the most from the hunt and were able to provide the most food to their families.  While an excellent body equaled a great potential as a hunter, without the nerves of steel, patience and willingness to take risks, such a body was like a well-made sword in the hands of an idiot.  While the woman's power primarily resided in her body, the male's power essentially came from his actions and deeds that originated from his thoughts and emotional prowess.  These types of characteristics, that were a product of a mental and emotional makeup, became qualities that females universally found attractive.As Doc Love identified, the three characteristics that woman universally respond to emotionally is challenge (not psychologically needy or weak), control (able to not let passions overwhelm a person) and confidence (able to take charge of the situation and respond assertively).  This has not changed much for thousands of years.It became clear to me that what women find attractive in men is the qualities of an accomplished hunter: a killer.  Doc Love then goes onto explain in the same article that, "the Reality Factor says: beauty always finds the money and money always finds the beauty."  Underlining the attractive qualities in a man is a woman's desire to find a good provider: a powerful individual who can get the job done.  Women are extremely practical and they will go for the guy who can provide the most for them (as long as he is not a total genetic reject).  Money is obviously a display of wealth and sometimes an indicator of personal success and high status (powerful man).  However, I can imagine a lot of these beautiful women are simply mercenaries and are not actually responding to the individual at all but rather his income (money then becomes the powerful substitute for the powerful individual).  Do these mercenaries really love (greatly emotionally responded) to their millionaire or billionaire boyfriends? Doubtful, I would guess.I was not interested in the women who went for the money.  I wanted to know about those beautiful women who turned downed the power avenue of money to go for the individual they emotionally responded to as being powerful. In order for these beautiful women to go for these guys (they can have any guy and remember they are going to find the one they consider the most powerful) there must have been something extremely attractive, from a female standpoint, for such a woman to go for such a guy.  What type of guys attracted these women? Why was I so interested in these individuals?  Simple.  If I could discover their mental frame set, I could find the babes.To my dismay, as Doc Love noted, and from personal experience with a "9", the type of individuals these beauties would go for were drug dealers, crazed musicians, and sometimes "borderline (or even full on) criminal type[s]".At first I thought this was crazy.  How could these individuals get the babes?  I pushed on and began to ask myself the series of questions:What were these individuals like?  What was their mental frame set?  What was their general attitude to life?Doc Love laid the clues for the answer: quote:  Still, there is one thing that the types of males that I've described above have in common.  They're all rebels in some way.  They're not socially acceptable. . . .Also, as strange as it sounds, dangerous men make many women feel safe. . . . She knows that he'll crush any other guy who hassles her, and beautiful women do get harassed a lot.The other thing that all these types of guys tend to have in common is a kind of detached, "don't give a crap," attitude.  So these 10s perceive them as extra manly, confident and a Challenge.These guys displayed what appeared to be extreme qualities of confidence, challenge and control.  What gave them these outward qualities was a severe somewhat detached outlook on things.  A type of detachment that did not care about things in general.  Here was your super hunter, a dangerous individual: cool, calculating, infinitely patient and not shaken by anything.  Here was the mind of a true killer.  Here were the outer manifestations of the master DJ mindset.  My mind began to spin at this point.  I knew all the pieces were here to start to get inside the mind of these individuals.  It was at this point Nietzsche came to mind that showed me the way.   quote: What is good? -Whatever augments the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself, in man. What is evil? -Whatever springs from weakness. What is happiness? -The feeling that power increases-that resistance is overcome. Not contentment, but more power; not peace at any price, but war; not virtue, but efficiency . . . (The Antichrist - 2) Here was the essential glue I needed to put the puzzle together.  Power in the super hunter was the ability to overcome all resistance.  This overcoming of resistance led to efficiency. I was getting very close.  Then it was something that Pook began to crystallize everything: quote:Masculinity is surmounting your environment. This is why girls want that 'trump' attitude, the attitude that you can do anything. It is something biological. Women respond to jerks, to strength, first because they know the artificial world they live in may collapse and need someone to depend on. Masculinity is all about not being concerned of your environment and having that 'trump' attitude. . . .Be the master of your destiny. If she rejects you, she is merely showing she has bad taste. You're the MAN. It is your job to create the reality you would like. Don't let her do it because she never will. What did the super hunter overcome? Sure he was able to get the prey, but that was a product of his actions that originated from his mindset.  The greatest resistance the hunter faced was not his environment but his mental environment.  This was the true source of his power: the overcoming of all his fears, memories, teachings and so on.  His detached non-caring attitude let him discard all of it away.  In its place was true simplicity and efficiency.  Now the super hunter would simply note the values, use them when appropriate or discard them when needed.  He now ruled his world, because he now created it for he was the sole creator of value.  He was the one who decided to go with an impulse; he was the one who decided whether the fear was appropriate. He did not care whether he succeeded or not; it was irrelevant.  All that lay in front of him was movement of his mind and his emotions.  He trusted only what he felt and saw and would only give value to things that he himself felt were good.  The only thing he gave heed to was the moment.  He did not care that people found him mean.  He did not care that they loved him.  What were they to him?  What did they know?  He did not care to be defined by others nor did he let his emotions define him.  He embraced his emotions when appropriate and threw them away when he did not think they were helpful to his cause. Finally, he overcame one of his greatest impediments: his ego.  Instead of thinking that it would make me look better in the eyes of others, or to do so would make him look bad in others eyes, he simply did not care.  Here we see the rebel emerge.  A rebel who cares not what society thinks, what his mother or father thinks, what books say is right and not what his emotions or thoughts tell him.  He could care less. He is the only one who decides if it is worth caring about.Finally, the super hunter discarded the last hindrance to his goal: time. He is no longer obsessed with getting something achieved in a given time frame.  Such pressures are useless and counter productive in attaining the goal.  For he could care less when it was achieved: he was not living on anyone's timetable.  Nature taught him that events occur when they occur and cannot be rushed or delayed: a tree could not be rushed to grow, a flower would only bloom in spring, a prey had to grow weary from the strain of pursuit.  The only thing he concerned himself with was not the future or the past but the present moment where his realm of experience existed: the only time where he had a say in.Pook further goes on to say: quote:You do not compete against the girl or against any guy. Your competition is yourself. Think when training for sports. When you think, "My, that guy is good. I am going to beat him!" you will either (a) fail or (b) succeed then stop. Your focus is on HIM, not yourself. Once beating him, you stop. A woman is a woman. You are the one that makes an issue of it.  You are the only one that gives it a value. If you make a big deal out of something, it will be a big deal.  Conversely, if you make it a lesser deal than it is, it will be a lesser deal.The greatest obstacle in getting a woman is not the woman but ourselves.  The greatest act of power the super hunter achieves is to overcome all of our self-imposed limitations.  How do get rid of all your self-imposed limitations?  THROW IT ALL AWAY!  Don't care what others think, what your emotions tell you, rationalize yourself and just do it!  Let yourself be the focus and sole determiner of whether something is good or bad.The super hunter no doubt treated women the same as the hunt or anything in his life.  The following examples are mental demonstrations of the truly powerful mind set.  To help accentuate the qualities of the powerful mindset I have in tandem also presented the un-powerful or AFC (Average Frustrated Chump) mindset to function as a foil. See and feel the far greater simplicity and efficiency in the overall thought process of the super hunter in comparison to the AFC's.  Also note the following qualities associated with the powerful mindset:1) It is goal orientated with a final long-term situation envisioned.  However, this is always implicit in every situation.2) The powerful mindset does not recognize success and failure.  It is simply the recognition that an obstacle has been put in place, or an obstacle has been removed. Success or failure becomes tied to simply degrees. One simply sees either one is getting closer to the goal or moving away from it.3) The value of something or the course of action in the given situation always revolves around whether the value or course of action further or hampers the goal desired.  No other subsidiary or tangents are taken into account. 4) The realm of attention is only focused at the current present situation at hand.  The mindset neither adds nor removes anything from the situation. It is objective.5) The various emotional value and thought values are taken into consideration but if are unwarranted they are discarded.  Those values that are not discarded then influence the course of action.  Emotional values are primary. 6) The moment is only taken into account.  Any future or past considerations are put aside. 7) The final consideration in the course of action has to do with what is costs the individual in either furthering or delaying the goal.8) The only past knowledge that is applied to the decision process is only knowledge the individual has personally experienced.9) The final outcome is always action.  10) There is no doubt, fear or uncertainty. 11) Most importantly, the powerful man chooses, no one else, the course of action.I have included in each example two scenarios: a hunting scenario and the other a dating scenario. As it is my hypothesis that the ultimate DJ mind originated from the ultimate hunter mind, it becomes easier to derive the dating scenario in reference from an analogous hunting one.Italics will indicate either an emotional or thought associated value judgment that both the AFC and powerful male experience and responds appropriately to. Everything in braces [] indicates physical actions or reactions.  Indents indicate a conversation.Hunting Scenario:  A Potential Prey is Spotted.  This prey doesn't look worthy to hunt.AFC:  Maybe I should still go for it though.  May be a waste of energy though.  But it doesn't look like there is much else here.  I haven't had a decent prey in a long time.  I guess this is better than nothing.  Powerful Male: Prey no good. Move on. [moves to a different hunting area]AFC Result:  Spends useless amount of energy chasing something from the beginning did not look promising.Powerful Male Result:  Found better prey later on.Dating Scenario:  A Potential Woman to Approach and Talk to.  Woman is not all that attractive at all and has a folded body posture with a scowl on her face. AFC: Maybe I should go talk with her.  You know what they say, "It's not beauty that counts but what is inside."  She looks not too happy maybe I can cheer her up or something.  I haven't talked to a girl in a long time.Powerful Male: Ugly. Uptight. Move on to other women. [Leaves premises]Results: Same as above. Hunting Scenario: An Excellent Looking Prey is Spotted.  Prey looks very good AFC: Yes, a prey!  I hope I don't screw up with this one.  I should be extra cautious, no wait extra bold.  I hope my spear is in good order.  I did sharpen it, didn't I?  [This continues].Powerful Male:  Prey appears to be worth the effort to hunt it.  It is in a good position to strike. Emotional fear is experienced.AFC: My god, I don't know if I can do this.  This is way too difficult for me. It's probably too much hassle anyway.  Maybe in a minute I'll gather enough courage. [looks at spear]Powerful Male: Is this fear warranted?  I am not in a position where I can be harmed.  The fear is unwarranted.  [tosses spear]  AFC Result:  In hesitation, the prey runs away and he looses his chance.Powerful Male Result:  Manages in wounding the prey and slows it down. Dating Scenario: A Beautiful Engaging Woman is Encountered.  Beautiful Woman.  AFC: Oh, my gosh, a beautiful woman!  My god, I'm sure she must have a boy friend.  I bet she is out of my league.  Powerful Male:  Strike the concept beautiful out.  It adds nothing and it doesn't help. She is not a princess, someone special super human.  She is simply a woman that a lot of men emotionally respond to.Emotional fear is experienced.AFC: Boy, I'm so afraid.  I'll probably screw up.  Maybe in a minute or after a few drinks, I'll find enough courage.  I wonder whether I'm good enough looking, I wonder what she think of me?Powerful Male: Is this fear justified?  Is she holding a gun or appearing hostile to me?  No.  No justification. [approaches woman]AFC Result: Woman gets up and leaves while AFC is drooling and thinking how to approach her.Powerful Male Result:	Powerful Male: Hi, would you like to buy me a drink?	Woman: Boy, you seem confident, don't you?	Powerful Male: I know nothing about confidence: I simply am.	Woman: [turns wet]Hunting Scenario: Back at Camp wondering if Ever will get a Great Kill Thought of never having a great kill.AFC: I have not really ever made a great kill.  I think I am not a good hunter.  My family will be ashamed of me.  I've just turned out to be an average hunter.Powerful Male: By whose definition of "great"? How does this thought contribute to my hunting ability? It serves no useful purpose. Feelings of depression.AFC: I really am a bad hunter. [starts crying]Powerful Male: There has been no death, no loss. Unwarranted. Drop it. [goes hunting].Dating Scenario: At home Wondering if will Ever get a GirlfriendThought of not having girlfriend.AFC: No one has ever really loved me.  It must be something wrong about me. Maybe I'm not friendly enough.  Maybe I should change the way I look.  I don't know.Powerful Male: Irrelevant. Past is past; I can't change it. How will this thought help my future? My plan is to meet women not dwell on them. Feelings of depression.AFC: I really suck. [starts crying]Powerful Male: I have not lost anything or nothing terrible has happened. Drop it. [goes out and meets women]Hunting Scenario: A Prey being Hunted appears to be more difficult to kill than first anticipated.[Prey goes through rough terrain making it difficult to hunt.]Feeling of frustration.AFC: Oh, no prey is getting away.  I cant let this happen, I must pursue at all costs.  [follows prey close behind]Powerful Male: Is frustration warranted?  Yes. Prey is posing obstacles in the pursuit of it. Need to get rid of obstacle.  Try different route through terrain to catch it.[Prey goes through rough terrain and is able to surmount a very difficult area full of streams and caves.]Feeling of fear.AFC: Oh, no the prey is getting more and more difficult to catch. I cant let up now.  [rushes blindly after it]Powerful Male: Is fear warranted?  Yes. Prey has a good chance of getting away.  Is it worth pursuing it if I have low chance of success?  No.  Try to find other prey.AFC Result:  Spends a useless amount of energy pursuing a prey that eventually gets away from him.Powerful Male:  Cutting his loses, he regroups, learns a little more about the terrain and finds another suitable prey.Dating Scenario: Going out on a first date with a woman to take her out to dinner.Male: Were going to eat at an Italian restaurant.  Woman: No. I hate Italian food.Negative feeling experienced.AFC: Oh, no. She hates Italian food.  Wait let me see.  I can try Thai, no how about Chinese? Im not too partial to Chinese, but maybe shell like it.Powerful Male: Is negative feeling warranted?  Yes, she is making situation difficult.  Try an alternative.  I like Thai.	Male: Were going to eat at a (Thai or Chinese) restaurant.	Woman: No. I hate that as well.Increased negative feeling.AFC: Oh, this is getting real bad.  Let me come up with something else.  How about Mexican, my God I hope she likes that.Powerful Male: Negative feeling is warranted.  Situation is becoming very difficult.  She is not helping at all and being unnecessarily difficult.  I am not experiencing positive feelings. Amount of effort and ill feelings is outweighing the good ones. Drop her.AFC:	AFC: How about Mexican?	Woman: No, I ate Mexican earlier today.Powerful Male:	Powerful Male: Im taking you home.AFC Result: Ends up driving her all over the place and making suggestions. She finally says she is not hungry and just want to go for a drink. He never gets anywhere further with this woman.Powerful Male Result: He takes her home. Hits a bar and gets a home phone number. Hunting Scenario: The kill is made and the Hunter enjoys the fruit of his labor.Positive feelings of success.AFC: Im the greatest hunter there is.  Everyone is going to think Im the greatest. Im going to tell everyone about my hunt tomorrow. I did so well . . .Powerful Male: Is the positive feeling justified?  Yes.  Feeling of sleepiness.AFC: Oh, Im tired. Who cares? Im going to celebrate into the early hours, and sing me a tale.Powerful Male: Feeling justified? Yes. It was a long hunt. Need to have energy for tomorrows hunt. Will settle in contented sleep.  [goes to sleep]AFC Result: He spends up all night, and does not go on the hunt the next day and looses out on gathering food.  Powerful Male: Fully rested, he does well on the next hunt.Dating Scenario: Consummation is achieved with Female. Uplifting and positive feeling.AFC: Yipeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!  Im the man.  I love her so much.  Ill tell her tomorrow morning.  I bring her roses and flowers.  Maybe I should ask her to marry me?  This is the greatest.Powerful Male: Feeling justified. Yes. Nice. Was the pleasure worth the time spent with her.  Yes.  Feeling of tiredness.AFC: Boy, Im tired but let me compose a poem for her. [begins to write poetry]Powerful Male: Is feeling warranted? Yes, it has been a long day with physical exertion. Tomorrow is another day. [goes to sleep]AFC Result: The next day he declares his undying love and scares off the woman.Powerful Male result: Hes in her room with her right now.In all these scenarios the crucial difference between the AFC and powerful man is that the powerful man is the one who does not let the situation and his emotions dictate him as opposed to the AFC who lets it control him.  The hunter overcomes while the AFC is overcomed.As Pook points out: quote:A male who goes through life with the path of an arrow is a MAN. A male who goes through life bending himself to every desire in hopes of pleasing is CHUMP, a nice guy. The AFC is the one that bends over backward to try to accommodate his emotions, his environment and other people.  He is ruled and defined by it.  He does not possess the courage to choose for himself what is best for him and go ahead and do it.The powerful male chooses his action himself. He does not let his mother, his brother, his teacher or the junkie on the street corner that gave him the finger let him choose the way he should think or act. He decides what is important. He decides what value to give things: he creates his own world because he interprets it and responds to it on his own terms.Nietzsche talks about the three metamorphoses of the spirit: quote:THREE metamorphoses of the spirit do I designate to you: how the spirit becometh a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.Many heavy things are there for the spirit, the strong load-bearing spirit in which reverence dwelleth: for the heaviest longeth its strength. . . .All these heaviest things the load-bearing spirit taketh upon itself: and like the camel, which, when laden, hasteneth into the wilderness, so hasteneth the spirit into its wilderness.But in the loneliest wilderness happeneth the second metamorphosis: here the spirit becometh a lion, freedom will it capture, and lordship in its own wilderness. . . .My brethen, wherefore is there need of the lion in the spirit? Why sufficeth not the beast of burden, which renounceth and is reverent?To create new values - that, even the lion cannot yet accomplish: but to create itself freedom for new creating - that can the might of the lion do.To create itself freedom, and give a holy Nay even unto duty: for that, my brethen, there is need of the lion. . . .But tell me, my brethren, what the child can do, which even the lion could not do?  Why hath the preying lion still become a child?Innocence is the child, and forgetfulness, a new beginning, a game, a self-rolling wheel, a first movement, a holy Yea.Aye, for the game of creating, my brethen, there is needed a holy Yea unto life: its own will, willeth now the spirit; his own world winneth the world's outcast. (Zarathustra I,1)Do you have the courage of the lion to choose to create freedom in your life with a "holy Nay" to all that has burdened you?  Do you then have the ability to forget and say a "holy Yea" to all that you are as a human male with sexual drives and desires, a "holy Yea" to what you and only you enjoy and hold dear? Only you are responsible for your life and how you view it.  You are responsible for your own destiny. Believe it or not, you choose if you are an AFC or not. No one chooses for you except you. Happiness is right in front of you because it is in your mind.  You need to decide whether you want to reach out and grab it or simply continue the path that takes you away from being true to yourself and what it is to be a man.You possess the most powerful tool to power and success: the ability to choose - the will of the spirit.You have the choice.  Choose life, choose happiness, choose power.

A lot of issues have been covered in the bible, but I can't find one that covers the easiest & cheapest accessory to master, so I'll take a shot. Your instincts. Are you in tune with them, or do you ignore them? Since we've all been raised in this AFC world, you might just forget to recognize them anymore since they've been beaten out of us since childhood.. The hot chick who sits next to you in class everyday, the cute cashier who can't make eye contact, or the friend of a friend who seems intent on talking to you even though you havent even been introduced yet. These are the times that your gut serves you best. Here is an exercise to teach you, the aspring DJ, to get in touch with your instincts next time they are called into question: Flip a coin.You've got two choices; lets say Burger King is heads, and Taco Bell is tails. <Flip>. What did you end up with? Tails? How do you feel about that? Maybe you really wanted to hit up BK for another whopper, even though it would be your third one today. That's your instinct at work! You're disappointed about going to Taco Bell. Your gut says "no, I still want that damn whopper", even though the coin toss should have decided it. Your disappointment is actually your true feeling, the other side of the coin was your brain telling you to make the rational decision and change it up a little. Insert your own choices and flip the coin a couple of times a week to see what the difference is between what you want and what you should do. You'll be amazed at how much you find out about yourself.<instinct>"Damn, that girl is hot! Why is she sitting by herself? Maybe I should go up and introduce myself, she did make eye contact with me twice."<rational thought>"Nah, I bet she's got a boyfriend who will show up any minute. I'll just sit and wait for a while to see what happens."An hour goes by and no boyfriend. She leaves, looking at you one more time, and you're smacking yourself for not going through with your original plan. That symbolic last look was your instinct getting kicked in the ass by self-preservation. Your first feeling is almost always right, your first thought is almost always to the contrary. Learn to listen to that little voice that shouts "Yes, touch her leg!" or "Yes, ask for her number!" before your thought process can get a hold of it and beat it into submission. Sometimes these two are in harmony, but by the time everyone agrees, it's usually too late. Sort of like the United Nations. The moment is now. No one ever made a scrapbook filled with things they could have done. If you had to choose between the greatest critic and the best mentor to spend the next lifetime with, which would you go with? I thought so. Never ignore your own internal mentor, he's the best ally you'll ever have.------------------"When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro."  -Hunter S. Thompson

    <h3>
    How to Eliminate Desire 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


So what makes a person an AFC?  Is his style?  Is it his looks?  Is it the things he says? No.  What makes an AFC is himself.  More specifically, it is his internal scripts or mind set that makes him the way he is.The AFC's internal scripts are varied and mostly jumbled.  But there are usually three main components to them that I will discuss each in turn.  Personalizing everything A chump has the tendency to over analyze everything and worry about saying the right thing or the wrong thing, interpreting any negative response from a woman as his doing and so on.  By putting such an emphasis on the me the AFC places himself at the center of the situation and finds himself having to react and question every single little thing.  He is so worried of screwing up he overwhelms himself because he thinks he must do everything right in order to get anywhere with the particular lady.Believing that things will stay the sameAn AFC takes rejection badly and thinks that because one woman rejected him, they all will reject him.  Even though he may at one point think he has a legitimate chance, he becomes so worried because of the past experience that he short circuits himself and fulfils his self-proclaimed prophecy which just reinforces his erroneous belief.Attributing failure with women as a failure in lifeThe AFC has the tendency to put such an emphasis on woman that she becomes the all-being consuming focus in his life.  When failure occurs with a particular woman he believes that his failure in dating (just one area of his life) means he is a failure in his entire life.  Such thinking leads him to overwhelm himself with a total feeling of inadequacy.  With such an erosion of confidence, the chump can hardly get himself to talk to a woman anymore, much less date.In psychology these aspects are referred to as internal (concluding that whatever happens is all your doing), stable (viewing a situation as permanent) and global (believing that what you experience in a given situation affects everything you experience) mental attributions.  Studies have shown that these types of attributions are a recipe for disaster in viewing life in general and are the chief mental characteristics of people who are depressed or prone to depression.To get an idea of the mind set, it as if I walked up to you and told you that in order not to be publicly humiliated in front of the whole world as a looser, you had to perform 800 complicated tasks perfectly with the odds succeeding around 1 in 10,000. Could you be confident in this situation? Could you remain totally calm and controlled? Would you not feel overwhelmed? These internal scripts cause him to be overwhelmed in the presence of women which results in poor actions and behavior that causes him to fail.  While these scripts may be a result of a general outlook to life, these scripts tend to manifest themselves because the chump has such an intense desire to not be alone (to have someone emotionally stimulate him) that he makes the woman out to be something far greater than she is: he puts way too much emphasis and importance in a single woman. To make the situation even worse, a woman can tell a desperate man a mile away. A man who is needy, supplicating and clingy is the ultimate turn off. So what then is the secret of being more successful with women?  The key is to do the opposite of what the chump does.  As Dex in the "Tao of Steve" says: quote: Rule 1 of the Tao of Steve: Eliminate your desires. If your out with a girl and you are thinking of getting laid, you're finished. A woman can smell your agenda. When you interact with a woman and she senses no desire in you, it does a lot of things.  First of all, she will feel more comfortable with you.  Secondly, by her sensing you are not lusting after her, it causes her to become confused as to why you are not lusting after her like every other guy does: it makes you stand out.  By not overtly desiring her, you become a challenge. Because of the affront to her ego, she all of a sudden wonders how she can make you become more attracted to her or at least notice her. Finally, you will more easily have fun and be more fun to be around which will make women respond more positively towards you.So how do you eliminate your desire?  To answer this question, we must understand what desire really is.The essence of desire is wanting things to be other than present experience is.  In otherwords, the AFC is focused more than outcomes rather than focusing on the present moment.  This is the entire key.The AFC, after meeting a woman for the first time, is usually so caught up with her (imagining things like marriage, great sex, how a great person she and so on) he builds a complete fiction of who she is because he desperately wants her to be that special someone. When he finally goes on the date, he worries so much of saying or doing the wrong or right things (concerned with the outcomes of his actions or words) he is rarely even mentally there with the woman at all. Instead of concentrating on finding out who she really is, he acts and prances about under the pretense that he already knows who she is  that special woman. But of course, this special woman is nothing but a self-imposed fiction. Because of his intense desire, his ego becomes inseparably involved in the process and the AFC tries to impress her or put on pretenses so as to tell her that he is better than all the rest of the guys she has been with. This type of act actually psychologically tells the woman that he is in fact insecure because he feels the need to remind her that he is better than all the rest.All a woman really gets from this guy is a nervous, conniving, needy, blabbering fool that appears more occupied in himself than her. Because the guy is not really in tune with her (not really in the moment with her because of his chief concern with the outcome of the date), she senses that the craving is not for her at all but something from her: sex.  Like Dex says, "A women can smell your agenda."The essence of the chumps problem lies in wanting the woman existing in front of him to have a higher interest in him than what the apparent situation presents her interest as.  More simply, the AFC wants the woman to like him so he tries to do things to make her like him. This is a chump in a nutshell.After seeing what desire is, it becomes apparent how to finally eliminate desire.If desire, as I so define it, is wanting things to be other than they are, then the elimination of desire is simply accepting the situation as it truly is, or to put it another way, going with the flow of things in the current situation.  As Dex says, quote:Look at me. Technically, I shouldn't get laid, but I do.  And you know why, Dave?  Because when I'm hanging out with a woman that's all I doing: hanging out, talking, listening, and I'm not sitting there thinking how I can get in bed with them. When you are immersed in the situation and not worrying about the outcome, you concentrate on the situation instead of the outcome of the situation. By so doing you become more fully present in the moment, unlike the chump that mind is elsewhere.As the Buddha stated to a man who wanted a succinct teaching:  quote:In the seeing, there is only the seen. In the hearing, there is only the heard.  In the sensing, there is only the sensed.  In the thinking, there is only the thought.When you are out with a woman, simply be with the woman.  When you are talking to her, simply talk to her.  When you are kissing her, simply kiss her. Get rid of the idea of a date in your mind. Simply think you are going to meet a woman, not a special woman, not a beautiful woman, not a woman who will satisfy your desires, but simply a woman.When you are in the state of just being present in the moment with her, you will naturally exude confidence, control and challenge because you are not trying to be anything and you are not trying to achieve anything.  The confident man doesn't even think of confidence, he simply is.  The controlled man appears naturally in control because being in control is not an issue for him.  Finally, the man who is a challenge is not needy because he doesn't need the woman; he derives his pleasure from situations with a woman and not the woman itself.This type of state, where a person is fully present, is what Dex refers to as "being Steve."  Everyone has experienced being in the "flow" or peak states where tasks appear to be done effortlessly.  Dating is no exception.Whereas the chump goes ahead and tries to force things to happen, the Don Juan allows things to happen.  In a true Taoist fashion, it is when we are trying the least that we achieve the most success.Most importantly, when you are "being Steve" you are naturally having fun.  If you are dating and not having any fun, you are simply not dating.Above all else a woman loves a man who naturally appears to have his act together and is fun to be with.  Such a man, for all intensive purposes, is free and is loving and living life.  And when you are simply enjoying the moment, a woman will want to enjoy it with you.Enjoy life with or without women and simply be.[This message has been edited by DarkDream (edited 02-21-2002).]

    <h3>
    Why Do You Tolerate A Flakey Chick? 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Good Morning!I ask this question of all you guys out there who ask advice about finding your one true love, or the girl of your dreams.The typical scenario I see most every day here is :Guys, I need your help!  Im deeply in love with this girl, but she stands me up on at least half my dates.   How can I make her fall in love with me?!OrIm dating with the most beautiful girl in the world,  but shes always comparing me to her ex-boyfriend and telling me I should be more like him.Or My ex-girlfriend (who dumped me) wants to get back together with me.  She dated a good friend of mine for about two months, but dumped him too.  What should I do?Or one of my favorites (copied from an actual post)Hello All, Lately I have been with a girl with very high interest level. We met 6 months ago and there after she calls me almost everyday until now !!! I liked her also..but not so much. Anyway we started dating..but I found out that she wants to control me ..she chooses her type of movies, her type of food with no consideration whether I like it or not. So I told her that I want to break up. She agreed but she calls me everyday and asks me about my well being and concerns about my health..and stuff. I then met her again and officially broke up(second time) she cried..but things did not quiet down. She told me that she feels special and she wants to give her virginity to me. I met her recently and then tried to break up third time..then she FAINTED on the road and then I had to carry her to my apartment..which was nearby. Then after she got better we made love..her first time. So she became my girlfriend. BUT still she seems to be self-centerd and wants me to enjoy what she enjoys. The moment I want to do something..she has a long face and is very reluctant to do it. I am starting to hate her now...Guys please help me what to do.. I am confused.... !!!! She also told me that she has an adivsor friend that tell her what to do and how to get me..what the **** !!!My friends, these poor saps have been victimized by what I like to call a biscuit chick.  Shes hot, but flakey as hell.  I asked myself, Gipper, why do these guys put themselves through all this pain and suffering?  Its just a chick!  I think the answer lies in the following reasons1.	Shes the most attractive girl the guy has dated (so far).Im sure a lot of you guys eventually stumble onto a really hot chick.  She looks like some smokin little model or actress-type and you are so intent on keeping her for yourself that you would toss away any self-respect you had.Guys, there are plenty of fish in the sea.  Clich, I know, but it is truer than anything else youll read on this site.I dated a girl who was a spitting image of Catherine Zeta-Jones Douglass (or whatever the hell her name is now).  But guess what?  She was a spoiled little rich girl looking to drain my bank account.  When I called her on her leech-like practices, she threatened to stop seeing me.  I immediately took her home, ceremoniously burned her telephone number and never answered any of her calls again.  Case closed.  Next!Im now dating a girl who is the spitting image of Peta Wilson (the Le Femme Nikita chick).  (*Hmm. What is it with me and actresses?*)  If she loses her mind and starts acting goofy, shell get the same treatment.Hot chicks are usually high maintenance, but dont accept any crap she throws your way.  You are a DJ!  You can always do better!2.	You lost your virginity to the girl (or you deflowered her).You feel some kind of obligation because the two of you shared an intimate, personal moment together.  Especially if you deflowered her, she will latch on to you and do anything: cry, fight, lie, just to keep you around.  You have to detach yourself from the act.  Its over now; dont let your emotions cloud the fact that she is treating you poorly.3.	You feel pressure to have a girlfriend.I once knew a guy who was almost lost if he did not have a girlfriend handy.  If he broke up with some girl, or (most often), got dumped, he would be in a white-hot panic to find a replacement.  It was a disgusting display to watch; he was just looking for a warm body to walk around with.  Please suppress any feelings like these that you may have.  A girlfriend does not make you any more of a man, or even a DJ.  Co-dependency is ugly.4.	The sex was incredible.The girl just did things to your testicles that make you want to go buy a wedding ring for her.  Well, guess what?  Shes probably not the best at whatever she did to you.  This one is a killer, guys.  Sex.  Sex can make a guy do things that bamboo under the fingernails wouldnt even begin to touch.  Enough has been written about how a man was ruined by his pursuit of sex.  Look at Bill Clinton.  How much more successful could he have been if he had just kept it in his pants?  Now that I think about it, he really shouldnt have married an ice-queen like Hillary, but thats another story.  I mean, the chicks he picked out werent even good looking!  The little head often does the thinking for you, but dont let it.  What ever particular skill this chick has can be found elsewhere.  Dont get wrapped around her little finger just because she invented a new sexual position using her in-depth knowledge of yoga.5.	Youre in love.Highly doubtful.  Youre infatuated, at best.  Most guys turn their whole world upside down for no more reason than a warm, fuzzy feeling in their gut.There is no such thing as The One (with the exception of the Jet Li movie of the same name!).  The world is filled with beautiful women who need some lovin!  All you have to do is get out of the house every now and then and go find them.  Soulmate?  Bullsh!t!  Shes no more your soulmate, than Im your Daddy!  If you lose The One, just go out and replace her; its easier than you think.So, to sum up:  No matter how special you think your girl is, she can easily be replaced by another chick who is hotter, and can do just as many kinky things as your current chick.  You cannot fall in love with her after a coffee date, and no matter what moments youve shared, allowing her flakey behavior to rule the relationship is NOT the way a DJ should act.Gipper------------------"There's nothing wrong with letting the girls know you're money, and that you want to party.-Trent, from "Swingers""Keep your girlfriend away from me,Just advice Im giving you for free,Wanna have every thing I see,So keep your girlfriend away from me..."-Local H, from "Here Comes The Zoo"

    <h3>
    FEARLESS 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Jester got me thinking about this, in his post about kino. He correctly stated that fear is the reason some people are bad at it.Fear is so prevalent in our lives that we don't even recognize that it's there most of the time. I'm not talking about the kind of fear you have when you're running from a wild animal chasing you. That's acute fear. What I mean is the thing we sometimes call nervousness, or anxiety. But like I said, we don't always know it's there, so we don't really have a name for it. It's a constant presence in some people's lives.When you put off doing something, that's fear. You would rather go see a movie than mow the lawn. So the grass grows and grows, until it's a foot high. Because you were afraid to do something uncomfortable.Do you smoke? That's fear. It's a crutch, something that takes your attention from the responsibilities in your life.Is your house messy? This is similar to letting the grass grow. Do you always have your TV or radio on when you're home alone? Fear of being alone with your thoughts. You're fooling yourself into thinking you have company, and you're not so lonely.Do you shop too much? Drink too much? Eat too much? Gamble too much? Crutch, crutch, crutch, crutch. Fear, fear, fear, fear. Some people couldn't be more obvious if they wore a sign that said, "I am afraid of life."You want to get laid so bad, why don't you approach every hot-looking girl you see?Let's all just liberate ourselves a little, and admit to each other (or at least to ourselves) that sometimes in our lives we are afraid. It's okay. There are so many uncertainties in life that a little fear is necessary to protect ourselves. It keeps us sharp.If fear, on the other hand, keeps you from really enjoying life to the fullest, then it's gone too far.Here's a big area of my life where fear has held me back. I want to save money and invest it, because I know that having a lot of money in the future will bring happiness. But whenever I get a decent-size wad of cash in my bank account, I buy something I really didn't need that bad. Why? Because I have a limiting mind-set that tells me that the new CD player will ease my unhappiness in other unrelated ares of my life. It does, for maybe five minutes. I'm afraid to do what it takes to be happy in the long run, because without the quick fix, I'll have to live with some pain in the short term. Sound familiar to any of you smokers, overeaters, drinkers, gamblers, crackheads, etc?What if you had no fear? Just imagine. Whenever you had a thought to do something, you would do it. You wouldn't hesitate, and you would commit to reaching the goal. You would cut the lawn, and you would go to the movie afterwards, if something more important didn't come up in the meantime. Notice I said important, which doesn't necessarily mean fun. But you wouldn't care. Courage gives you priorities, and the strength to live up to them.You would stop smoking, you would stop eating too much, you would stop buying things, trying to fill that empty void in your life that can only really be filled by getting some balls.You could approach any woman you wanted to, and you wouldn't care what she said to you. Damn, I'm so tired of being afraid. I know you are, too. We all have some fear, so please, no responses about how you're not afraid of anything. I only say all this because I think this forum exists mainly to give advice that helps alleviate fears. If we can quickly learn things like kino, eye contact, and acting confident, then that saves us some of the pain of rejection we would feel going through the trial and error process, testing this stuff out on our own.I don't have the solution as to how you can get over your fears, but I do know you have to face them. You can lie to others, but don't lie to yourself. I know from conquering some of my own fears, that once you start doing it, you will feel empowered. And you will see just how messed up the rest of the world is.I hope everybody gets something out of this, because I only wrote it with the best of intentions.Live long and prosper.

    <h3>
    The 3 Keys of Success with the opposite sex... 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


I'm going to keep this short and sweet, and right to the point.  There are 3 crucial things you REALLY need to live by if you want to have any kind of success with the opposite sex.  Here they are:1) Have the balls to approach someone and let them know you are interested.  If you don't make a move you won't go anywhere.2) Don't be clingy and needy.  No one likes dingleberries, so DON'T be one!3) Learn to gracefully accept the fact that some people just aren't going to be attracted to you and some people are going to find that they just don't like you very much once they get to know you.  You have those same feelings about other people so it's really silly to expect that some others won't have the same feelings about you as well.  If it's not going well, just move on...it's not like there isn't anyone else to date.If you follow these relatively simple rules ALL of the time, you WILL be more successful with the opposite sex.

    The Ultimate Secret to Attracting Her To You 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Have you ever wondered why the more you want someone or something, the more that person or thing seems to avoid you? Well, this post may be the answer you've been searching for.Desire often creates paradoxical effects: The more you want something, the more you chase after it, the more it eludes you. The more interest you show, the more you repel the object of your desire. This is because your interest is too strong - it makes people awkward, even fearful. Uncontrollable desire makes you seem weak, unworthy, pathetic.   You need to turn your back on what you want, show your contempt and disdain. This is the kind of powerful response that will drive your targets crazy. They will respond with a desire of their own, which is simply to have an effect on you - perhaps to possess you.If choosing to ignore enhances your power, it follows that the opposite approach - commitment and engagement - often weakens you.Your best approach in attracting the girl you desire is to show her what you have to offer first (For example, show her your a fun guy to be with, honest, intelligent, confident etc) In other words show her some attention at first. Then withdraw this attention from her, so as to confuse her. Ingnoring her will make you appear more worthy, more powerful. The reason for giving her that initial attention is so that she is aware of what she is missing out on.Of what she has lost. If you start off right away by ignoring her, it will have very little effect on her because she won't be aware of what she has lost. It's true what they say: "You don't know what you have until you have it no longer".Rob, ------------------The Difference Between Winning and Losing, Is Knowing...

    <h3>
    Seduction without Speed 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


This isn't some Speed Seduction technique tip.  While I won't argue about the effectiveness of SS, I have never learned about it and hence have another method I go by.  Seduction is important to attracting women - some unfortunate bozos really don't realize this. While some guys may think that their good looks alone (unfortunately I'm one of those) are enough to attract chicks to sleep with them, good looks can only take you so far.  No matter how good-looking you are, if you can't seduce her, you'll never obtain what you want. If you're just average looking and you know how to seduce her then you won't have to be reading this article. Some guys here have such low confidence that they beat around the bush trying to fool the chick into their beds by using dumb pickup lines thinking it's the way to go.  A real seductor has the confidence to be honest and straightforward with his target, he knows what he wants and not afraid to show it. He doesn't have to use pickup lines in order to bed girls. A true seductor uses his seduction technique to lure the fish into taking the bait.Even if you have the perfect approach, it will not guarantee you success. But don't be discouraged; I can honestly tell that the rejection rate is very high when approaching women you don't have previous meetings with (even for good looking guys that get approach by women).  You might run into chick who already have BFs, don't have the time to stop and talk, having a bad hair day, or are just not interested. Don't blame yourself and don't let your ego take a hit. This is normal and happens to many men -- even players. Getting rejected by a stranger is part of the game - it's a fun part of the game because you can laugh at it.Ready:Always approach with a plan.  I can can improvise successfully (this is a pain trust me), but regardless of the case, having a plan always helps your chances of coming across as a person she might consider dating.Always be honest about what you want.  Don't hide the fact that you wanna get into her skirt - that's the thrill of it.  She already knows what you want, lying and fooling her is only gonna make you look like an idiot. Most guys think that they can fool a chick into giving them their number. Chicks already know that you're trying to pick them up, so don't beat around the bush. Be direct and let them know exactly what you want. You'll come across as a confident and straightforward man.Just be patient, Patience is good.  Don't rush into things like a hungry Hyena finding a dead carcass.  Have a good approach - be confident about your approach.  Know that you can get any girl you want and when you want - have this attitude always.  Don't end up looking like a little boy craving for ice cream.  Look into her eyes when you talk to her.  Do not stare at her breasts or let your eyes wander elsewhere.  Let your body language, your lips, and your eyes convey and explain your desire for her - your desire to touch her body and feel her skin.  Do not say it in words.  Avoid any sexual comments and quit gazing at her body at all times - keep your eyes to yourself pervert!Maintain a stimulating conversation.  Be original about things you say.  Use as less compliments as you can about her looks.  Remember, you don't want to come out like a rabid dog in heat.You need to look good, stylish and trendy. You don't necessarily need to look like a model - but it wil definitely help. Take time to look your best.  Make it look like you at least invested some time and money on your looks, not like some bum off the street. That goes without saying: maintain proper hygiene. Have a little fashion sense: go with a trendy shirt, a pair of decent pants, and maybe even an alternative hairstyle (don't go too far).Appear friendly and approachable.  A good smile will definitely do the trick, show those gorgeous whites gents.  A lot of women aren't comfortable talking complete stranger so it's up to you to make yourself appear harmless - not like a lost puppy dog mind you, just friendly and approachable.  A little humor usually helps. Be the charming man.  To attract beautiful women, you project confidence, good-looks (or appearance of looking good), intellect (yes, very important), and the most important of all, your charm.  How do you show charm?  Look into her eyes when you speak to her - let her know that you are comfortable to be with her without telling her.  Eye contact always.  Stimulate her mind and make her think. Just show her that you respect and value her opinion by asking her questions related to current affairs.  Laugh at her jokes even if it isn't funny (this is really hard, but you can just laugh at how stupid her joke really is) Show her that there are other things on your mind besides sex. Avoid topics related to sex, sports, ex-girlfriends, money, cars, and so on.Seduce her emotions and play with it.  If you can make her feel then you're on the right tract.  Make her excited, give her that rush of adrenaline that she always wanted go on a bike ride ask her to go sky diving with you.Make her believe that you are real with all your intentions.  Leave an open mind.  Make her feel beautiful about herself without saying it in words.  Again, use your body language and your eyes to accomplish this.  Feed her ego without setting yourself up as a stooge.  Appear to be a person who would give her pleasure.  Light touches to errogenous zones (when invited) is the way to go.  Just keep practicing this.  The more you do it the better you become at it.  Improvise, just because the above methods worked for me doesn't mean it will work for you - just have a plan and be dynamic.[This message has been edited by Adonis (edited 07-06-2001).]

    <h3>
    EREAKA! I've thought of a foolproof way into seducing a girl!!! 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


OMG everyone, I've just had this insane revelation that is a totally foolproof (alomst!) way!!!I'll give steps so it's easy... This assumes you are at the end of the date, and that you are being dropped off at her place, or you are showing your place. Also, it also assumes that you know your kino, and SS patterns or whatever smooth phrases to use...1. You and your date are in either a Cab, and are at her or your place. If it's at her place, do a closing and hope that she asks you to come in with her. If its at your place, you invite her over to show have coffee, or some more drinks. If she accepts your in. If you and your date are in her car, you probably should be at your place (dropping each other off right with you being the first to go cuz she's gotta make it to her place). You invite her to have some more drinks, etc...If you and your date are in your car, this assumes that you've already agreed to have her over.2. Now that you two are inside your house, ask her to take off her shoes or (maybe not if they're which look like they hurt... but take yours off, and give her a grand tour (important)... bring her to every room and make the living room last. Don't show anything off to her that are in other rooms, show the stuff in your living room when you are there!3. Ok, now you are in the living room, you should have lots of things to comment on. A TV, or stereo system, if not that bookshelf or fish are good. Have some plants too, big ones that you don't have to take care of much. Have a coffee table, or endtable or whatever, and have A recent newspaper, rolled to a section that might have some skin, perhaps the fashion section. Have some magazines too, latest and/or last moth's in combo's too, GQ is good, Popular Mechanics, Time, and Newsweek is good, Maxim, is iffy... have it open or really close by (she might pick it up and flip some pages...) to a sex tip section (this presumes that she may want to try it with you! Hope that she does!) Now that you have literature out of the way. Have a picture or painting of like a decent landscape... eg sunset. And have lots of items of interesting things with links to them! ie, souvineers from places like Egypt, Paris, Beijing, or wherever isn't normal for people to every year to go vactationing there. If it's a normal place like San Fransisco, LA, Orlando, NYC, then make sure it's not some post card, make it something interesting I can't think of anything, but this is so key!! YOU MUST HAVE THINGS OF INTEREST THAT WILL MAKE HER WONDER AND ASK YOU QUESTIONS, AND THEY MUST BE RELATED TO SOMETHING IN YOUR ROOM!!! The position of the remote for the tv may be important, if it's close by and easy to reach, then she might opt to flip on the TV, thus loosing her attention to you, but I don't know how well TV works... (****Make sure that you have a remote for the stereo or controls ON THE WAY IN TO YOUR LIVING ROOM**** this is so that you can smoothly turn on your music as if it was something that you do all the time you come in after work) Make sure that music is appropriate, I remember a post I think saying jazz is the best genre. I'll post later on what actual artists and songs are best for that.4. Anyways, you're in her living room, with music on, if you have dimmers set them to a lower than usual brightness, and ask her if she would care to have a drink. This is where you will leave her for about 1-3 minutes, do not ask her to take a seat, tell her "make yourself at home, and I'll be right back"Things you should have available for drinking: Have some beer, and some vodka and rum, and Coke (some cokes should be diet, you know how girls are...) have coffee or tea too.If it's beer, make sure they're bottles, and make sure it's fukkin' cold! Take your time getting the bottle opener, fumble around looking for it in the pile of the misc. utensils drawer. When you find it, bring the two bottles and bottle opener with you to the living room. This should take about 1-3 mins, with her being alone. If it's coffee and tea, set it up in the kitchen, again 1-3 mins or however long it takes, and while the water is reading up or the coffee brewing, get the dishes and cups ready. Sugar and milk/cream ready too! Make the coffee brew something very tastey and good, and easy for commenting! Not maxwell's, that's for your normal mornings.5. Go back to the living room, hopefully she'll have picked something up, or she may have wandered around looking at your important 'interesting items'. Ask her, "so did you find anything interesting?", hopefully this will lead into something that you can resond to well, and then pop in a SS pattern onto her. If its a small picture in a frame you can pick up (I dunno, of a dog?), pick it up and show it to her upclose, she may try to touch it, and you gotta touch her at this time! Same deal with smaller artifacts, I dunno, a small puppet or cut out mini sculpture, you can make it a hand crafted race car, and say that you made it yourself (ie assembled and stuff).5. During this time, you must find a place to put down a SS pattern down. You place it down, and while in the convo, go to something else of interest that you may think she would like (from what you've heard from her on the intersting thing that she mentioned before), and make sure that there is a physical piece of thing that is in your room of the same interest!!!!6. OK, now that you've told her about something else of interest, tell her that you have xxxxxx item in your room that she might like that's related that second intersting thing. Say to her someting along these lines "I have an xxxxxx that you might like. Come here, I'll show you!" while at the same time walking towards your room, but still keeping eye contact (maybe slowly walking backwards), take her hand too if you think it's right, like lunge for it.7. Now, you've got her in your room! (HAHA, this is when we really get down to business!) Dimmers, close blinds if existant, goto your item, grab it, and sit down on the side of your bed (this assumes that you dont' have a HUGE HUGE room). She'll come and sit down on it too, hopefully. Now this is where you have to lay down maybe another pattern down, or find a way to sneek in a question asking her if she'd like a massage, or shoulder rub. Find a way for this, this is real important too!!! You have to find a way to sneek it in, maybe she had a rough day, or week, ask her if she'd like you to relax her up w/ a massage. This is where you go down into the serious kino, and your major oportunity to hit the errogenous zones that will make her go horny. Look em up, and learn 'em (I dunno where they are, but I definitly know that they exist!)Get her to lay down, or get more inside of the bed. Oh yeah, make sure your bed is fukking made! Don't make it military style with everything tucked all tight and neat, just a made bed. Now massage her up.Foot massage allows for good eye contact, and good kino. Shoulder rub allows for little eye contact, but allows you to maybe do a smell thing on her (I read a post on it! It's in the DJ bible that Neophyte posted!)and I think the shoulder is closer to errogenous zones. If she seems like she's enjoying it, land a kiss somewhere, on the errogenouszones, maybe the ear? Tell her that she smells nice, or whatever, she looks beautiful, or like one of the most beautiful people that you've ever met, this is wher eyou lay a hardcore compliment that will flatter her and make her want to show you more of what she's got! Do some more kissing if she likes it, and you can slowly start to undress her, like reach around her body feeling her all over, and then if it's a slinky dress, slip that shyt off her, or if it's shirt/blouse, start to unbutton that but not all the way, enough for her to pull it off herself, keep feeling around, then make your way to her skirt, or pants. If it's a skirt, slide your hand up her skirt, and rub her around.And this is where I will leave it. I think we can all figure out how it can, and should end. So people, follow this, maybe not to the word, but pretty close. Adapt it to certain things of your personality. And hopefully this will help. Someone please try it, and see how it works! And report back! This looks like dynamite on paper!!

    <h3>
    Eye Contact (why it's important) 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


I always hear people saying, "make eye contact," or "look into her eyes."  My question was always...WHY?  What good does it do?  I'd hear things like, "it shows her you're confident," or "the eyes are the window to the soul."  OK...whatever that's supposed to mean.  So, I pretty much didn't consider eye contact that big of a deal.Then one day I found this article and my question was finally answered.EYE CONTACT:Direct eye contact triggers a primitive part of the human brain.  Unrelenting eye contact creates a highly emotional state similar to fear.When you look directly and potently into a woman's eyes, her body produces chemicals like phenylethylamine, or PEA, that jolts the sensation of being in love.To give the woman the subliminal sense that the two of you are already in love, dramatically increase your eye contact while the two of you are talking.Push it up to 75 percent of the time or more if you want to get the PEA gushing through her veins.TEST TIME:This sounded pretty interesting to me, so it was time to put it to the test.So, one night I head out to the local strip club.  I told myself that I would hold constant eye contact with one of the girls during a table dance.The first couple of dancers wouldn't hold eye contact with me.  Maybe they were just shy or something.  Then I finally got one who held it with me throughout the whole song.Other than a nice body, I had no interest in this girl at all.  About half way through the song, I start getting butterflies inside of my stomach.  I don't know what effect it had on her, but by the end of the song, I felt a sense of being in love with her.I'M NOW CONVINCED!!So, get out there and focus on this eye contact.  I know it's hard, but force yourself to hold eye contact for 75% of your conversation.  Also, give her a slight smile and a little head tilt.  This way she won't get all freaked out by you. She'll get the feeling that you're truely interested in her.

    <h3>
    Smiling 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


I'm sure all of you guys know that when approaching anyone (esp. women) nothing is more cordial and inviting than a bright eyed smile.  It is also a great way to gauge initial interest.  First of all, smiling puts everyone at ease.  It reassures them that you mean well and "come in peace."  It's fun and jovial and shows a caring, confident attitude.When someone smiles at you, very rarely do you not smile back.  Also a smile makes you feel a little better about your day.  It's as if someone saw something in you and it made them happy.  They recognized you, and that is the most flattering thing a total stranger can do for us.Now women behave rather interestingly when they are "interested" in us.  A smile and gaze into their eyes will always get a positive response and you will be seen as attractive (not to mention you are more attractive when you smile).  This serves you well and makes them think well of you.  If a woman is attracted to you, and you give her a warm smile (it has to be sincere and the eyes have to smile too), she will smile back and look at the ground or blush.  It's an involuntary reaction so she won't be able to help it.  The ice is already broken and you haven't even said a word.I must mention this...Don't Stare!  Smile and nod your head or say Hi.  Practice this constantly.  It will do wonders for your confidence because we are fueled by positive human interaction.  I remember someone once told me that to stay emotionally healthy we need a certain amount of touches by people a day (Yes, we are that needy).  Don't only smile at women to whom you are attracted.  Smile at everyone.  I once heard an old school pimp say you can tell a real player because every woman in the room is drawn to him.  You want to have that level of magnetism where everyone is drawn to you.  You don't want this to be rehearsed and contrived though.  It has to flow from your natural goodness and yearning for positive human interaction.  The reason we don't smile more often is because we're (esp. us guys) afraid to show our vulnerability and soft side.  The reason the smile is so effective is because you reflect goodness to someone.  When someone smiles at you, you feel good about yourself, and in turn about that person.  It gives you an emotional boost.  When you start letting this happiness flow through you (even if you aren't particularly in a good mood), you will see how other people positively respond to it and you will be affected by their response just as much as they were affected by your smile.Smiling also releases endorphins which calm you and make you happier.  In life there are leaders and followers.  There are those of us waiting for someone to smile at us and make us happy and there are those of us who are willing to give happiness first knowing that their happiness comes from making someone else happy.[This message has been edited by Rico (edited 07-23-2001).]

    Smile.....it'll make everyone wonder what you've been up to.

What happened to me today just reinforced the first rule of being sociable : Smiling.I had to give out leaflets today to help out with some advertising. I wasn't too bothered about it, and I didn't expect anything to happen from it. However this is where my natural charm kicked in.I wonder, have you noticed, that when someone smiles at you in a friendly way, you smile back automatically? It's something built in all of us. And today, while I was handing out the leaflets, I smiled at everyone I saw. Not a big-toothed grin, a simple, friendly smile. And sure enough, 98% of them SMILED BACK. No matter how sour or grumpy they looked, I got a smile out of most of them. Men, women, children, and the elderly. I got smiles.Of course there was that other 2%, but you know right away if they don't respond civilly to an innocent smile, they're probably too stuck-up and weird anyway. What is my point here? Simple. Next time you're at a party, or a club, or just walking down the street, if you see a woman that catches your fancy, smile. Simple as that. And you have an instant ice-breaker when she smiles back.  - Raoul

    <h3>
    Humor = Confidence 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


The question I always come across on this board from the new guys is along the lines of "I don't know what to talk about when I'm with her!" The key is to use humor and let it play itself out.Last night I met up with this honey for dinner and it was exactly like that - but I just am so confident about things that it never crosses my mind that I will run out of topics. But a sense of humor is very appealing to women - and once you get her laughing it is SO EASY to turn the discussion into whatver direction you like - I personally prefer sex. : ) And the way I use humor is to poke fun at who I'm with - talking about the tattoo she told me about on her ass, asking her where the back door is so I can sneak out, etc. All in good fun and it keeps everyone loose. So a few lame jokes last night and the next thing I know she is grabbing my knee and we are making out during the cab ride home. Think about a situation where you met a woman for the first time and you could tell there was no chemistry. Maybe when you saw her from across that room you really wanted to meet her, but once you appraoched and picked up on her disinterest, then you became disinterested and wanted nothing more to do with her. SAME EXACT THING! Attitudes are contagious! If you are having fun, so will she!Humor, above all, is a sign of confidence. Like any entertainer, you put yourself on the line - not everything you say will be found funny, but you are taking a risk...showing confidence. So there ya have it. And if you don't think you are "funny" enough to pull this off, remember...it's a state of mind. Have the confidence and mindset to think you are witty and entertaining and she will, too. TCB

    <h3>
    How to ATTRACT women...........Part II 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


I'm back......OK, here goes...1. Your attitude......This says alot about who you are....do you get discouraged easily? If so, then you'll have a tough time attracting anybody (guy friends included).....You must have a life with some passions and ambitions....Hobbies and interests are good......Are you in shape?....Most nice girls are pretty turned off by a fat, flabby, lazy toad. Do you spend alot of time on the couch watching TV while eating a family size sack of oreo's? If so, you really need to change your ways. Start jogging and lifting a few weights. It'll get you in better shape and give you a much better outlook on life. You don't need to be a "workout warrior", just enough to do the job.Do you like your job? If it sucks then go for something better.....I know this is easier said than done but a rotten job can really drag you down. Women love an ambitious guy! In short, do everything you can to start LIKING YOURSELF......It'll show, and girls will pick up on it....2. Don't be TOO picky! This is one of the major reasons why there are so many lonely adults everywhere. They demand pefection. Perfect looks. Perfect background, etc.,.....Most of the women you approach will have looks that fall somewhere between Cindy Crawford and the Goodyear Blimp. Real hot chicks are very powerful, and they know it. They turn alot of heads and get used to it. If you want to attract super-hot babes, get ready for a ton of competition. May not be fair, but who says life is fair? As for myself, I always looked for a good, clean, healthy appearance; nice teeth and smile, being just a tad overweight was OK, and lovely hands. Don't make the mistake of cutting yourself out of some good times just 'cause a girl doesn't look like a model. Nobody wants to go out with somebody who resembles a lineman for the Green Bay Packers, I know. But stop expecting Miss Perfect!3. Be an optimistic MAN WITH BALLS! You're not gay, are you? Then don't be ashamed of being masculine and approaching women! Stop worrying about appearing "obnoxious" when you approach a girl....besides, they love it! You think she'll hit ya? Scream for the cops? Not if you do it politely. You can't be a scared, chicken-hearted bastard and expect to get anywhere with woman. You must have confidence and self assurance. A wimpy guy gets rejected and goes home pulling the covers over his head and whining that "girls just don't like me"......The tough SOB gets turned down, shruggs it off, goes out with his buddies and has a good laugh over it. So whatever you do, grow up, get a life, and get some hard bark on yourself!4. Have a good sense of humor-------This, I believe, is the most important thing about yourself that you can develop. If you can get women to laugh then you have it made. It indicates supreme confidence and optimism. Everybody likes a guy with a good wit. I've never been a Republican, but I really liked President Reagan. Know why? I thought he was funny, he was charming and could make me laugh.....I didn't give a crap what his policies were! Humor is like paint, it covers alot.....5. Getting infatuated and falling in love/lust.......We all know the feeling; we see a gorgeous creature, we smile at her....she smiles back......you go for a little more contact; she gives you some good feedback.....you just can't wait to see her again; she seems pleased to see you......you go a little further; you don't want to come on too strong.......finally, you're about to bust and just have to tell her how great you think she is and what a crush you have on her and how you think it would be great to get together, and,........she suddenly turns colder than a year old corpse! You back off, wait a while to see if she misses you.............She treats you like a leper, is annoyed that you're even in the same country as she is........What do you do? Alot of guys can't handle this, they go off the deep-end, get depressed, get angry, and start saying stuff like "F**k all broads!, who need 'em!" "They're all a**holes anyway!".......The trouble with guys like this is that they get infatuated and smitten with somebody they hardly even know and get way too carried away. If you behave this way when some chick gives you the brush-off, then you're probably not too happy to begin with. I've always felt that women are "icing on the cake"; makes life a hell of alot better, but certainly not essential to my happiness. No woman on earth can make you that happy, ask any married guy, he'll tell you the same thing!So get a life, get tough, be independent, see the humor in things and NEVER FORGET:LIFE IS SHORT! YOU'RE GOING TO SOMEDAY BE LOOKING AT THE GRASS FROM THE 'ROOTS SIDE'......DON'T SPEND YOUR PRODUCTIVE, 'HARD ****' YEARS BEING A SOFT, OVER-SENSITIVE BABY!!!!!!SIEZE THE GODDAMN DAY!!!!!!Next: Part III

Damn cat woke me up.....I'm still half asleep......already on my 3rd cup of coffee........Here goes.....I've told you about looks and attitude, now you need to know the "How" stuff....It's easy, really. In fact, it's so simple that it's almost ridiculous.The answer is in the way you use YOUR EYES!!Yup, that's it.....you have to use your eyes....Unless you're blind, you use your eyes to communicate with women more than your mouth.Ever see any of the old "Dracula" movies? How did he "freeze" his soon-to-be victims? He used a hypnotic stare.I'm not suggesting that you try a "Dracula" approach.....or that you just stare at a woman like you're the village idiot....Eye contact can be very intimidating......Police are trained to use it to guage reactions to questions, etc.,....Direct eye contact with a woman, combined with a nice smile tells a woman "I like what I'm seeing, I am interested in you".....The reason most guys don't use it is because of fear and shyness. When you look at a woman you don't know and hold eye contact just a little longer than normal it let's the cat out of the bag, so to speak.....You must do it and not come across as a perverted moron......alot of it is timing....it always worked best for me when I was in "motion"....walking, turning my head directly towards them and smiling....I'm a married guy.....I don't do this stuff anymore (well, almost never) because it works so well that I don't want the temptation, it's that effective...Does it work on all women, everywhere, all the time? Of course not. But the ones who look back, taking notice of your eyes and smile, are attracted almost instantly.Why? Because it's flattering and mesmerizing, that's why! What if some nice looking babe does it to you? You're hooked!Eye contact with a good smile indicates confidence and self-assurance. Shy people can't do this, their eyes dart around everywhere.Remember.....use your eyes and smile, it's your God-given weapon......if they look back, and hold it for just a teeny-tiny second too long, you've attracted them!Next I'll talk about approaching......Later

    Moods are infectious! 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Ever notice how when somebody says something, and everybody else laughs, even if you don't think its funny, you often laugh too?  Happiness spreads.  If you act like you are always having a good time, laughing at jokes, etc. it will instantly put all the people around you into a good mood.  Everyone likes feeling happy, and you will develop a following, because you make people feel good.Likewise, if you are always down and depressed, people will want to AVOID being around you, because your mood drags theirs down too.  And honestly, who wants to be around someone who's busy feeling sorry for himself?  Happy, upbeat people usually control their social group.  Everyone likes someone who makes them feel good.  Everyone hates someone who makes them feel bad.  Keep this in mind, and the rewards can be incredible.   ------------------Please remember to use the "SEARCH" function in this forum on the topic you have questions about before asking, because it most likely has been answered already!

    <h3>
    The DJ Guide To Social Skills Part 1 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Was'up DJ's I'm a new member here, and have been following the site for a while, so I hope this helps. I got this from a Psychology Today magazine article and have found it useful.  So I'm going to post the most important things I found in it.The Eight Habits Of Highly Popular People1)Schedule Your Social Life"It is impossible to hone your social skills without investing time in them.  Practice makes perfect, even for the socially secure.  Accordingly, the well liked surround themselves with others, getting a rich supply of opportunites to observe interactions and to improve on their own social behaviours."When your'e with people look at their personality styles.  Its true, from some of my boys I've learned how to tell stories better with more detail.  I have a dry sense of humour, but I've picked up different kinds humour too, hanging around practical jokers.  Hang around different people, you'll become more well rounded socially.  That way you'll be able to attract so many [b]different types of girls, knowing different types of people and styles, just adopt it to yourself[/b].2)Think Positive"Insecure people tend to approach others anxiously, feeling they have to prove they are witty or interesting.  But self assured people expect that others will respond positively"Now this is very important DJs.  If you approach a girl nervous or anxious it will show, and she'll read you, or anybody for that matter.  Trust me, I know from first hand experience  3)Engage In Social Reconnaissance"Like detectives the socially competent are highly skilled at information gathering, always scanning the scene for important details to guide thier actions.   They direct their focus outward, observing others and listenting actively.Right.  When your'e around girls observe what they are like.  Analyze how they talk, how they walk, how they dress even.  Analyze everything.  You'll be able to tailor your approach to fit her persona.  You'll develop a better repore with her (even by using the same words she uses), and faster too.  Who knows, you might even find she's not your type. "Socially skilled people are tuned in to people's expressions of specific emotions, sensitive to signals that convey information as what people's interests are.""The socially confident are also able to identify and label their own experience accurately.  That is where many people particularly men fall short."DJ's be aware of you own emotions, that's the only way you will control them, otherwise they'll control you.  To master your emotions, don't wrestle or fight with them.  Acknowledge them, and accept them, even befriend them.  Don't let emotions like infatuation, frustration, fear, or other bull**** interfere, they're only shadows.4)Enter Conversations Gracefully"Timing is everything.  After listening and observing on the perimeter of a group they want to join, the socially competent look for an opportunity to step in, knowing it doesn't just happen.  It usually appears as a lull in the conversation."After observing jump in if your'e in a group with girls or there's one you want to talk to, you have to take chances in order to be great at what you do.  Like Muhammed Ali said, "Who will dare to be great, who will be bold". This is what you do, DJ'ing is a skill just like boxing, writing etc.To be great you must take risks "The idea is to use an open ended question that lets others participate"Common sales technique, they often start with who, what, where, when, why the 5 W's." 5)Learn To Handle Failure"It is a fact that eveyone will sometimes be rejected.  Rebuffs happen to even popular people.  What distinguishes the socially confident from mere mortals in their reaction to rejection.  They don't attribute it to internal causes, such as thier own unlikeability or inability to make friends.  They assume in can result from many important factors-incompatibilty, someone elses bad mood, a misunderstanding.""Self assured people become resilient, using the feedback they get to shape another go at acceptance."Failure is the one thing in life that tests your character, so consider it a blessing.  In weightlifting in order to get bigger in size you use extreme resistance, feeling the burn and breaking down the muscle until it recovers even stronger.  Failure does that to your character.  Use it as an opportunity to learn, and allow it to strengthen you.  Hey, I'm still learning.  Learning is an ongoing process.  I read something on Micheal Jordan's comeback, and he said the game is still teaching him things, amazing coming from probably the greatest ballplayer ever.  So allow this game to teach youRemember,"You don't have to be interesting.  You have to be interested.  That's how you have conversations."-Dr. John GottmanStay Tuned For Part 2   (But I don't have time write it just now )

    DJ Guide To Social Skills Part 2 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Alright DJ's I'll finish up here as well, continuing on The Eight Habits Of Highly Popular People article form Psychology Today March 20006)Take Hold Of Your Emotions"No one can pay attention to or correctly interpret what is going on, let alone act skillfully, without a reasonable degree of control over their own emotional states, especially negative emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety-the emotions that usually arise in situations of conflict and uncertainty."So true, I used to talk to fine girls I used to never pay attention to what they were saying because I was so concentrated on what I'd say next.  Then I'd get a little nervous and worry would come in to play.  Chalk most of this up to inexperience because it was a while ago.  But by taking hold of your emotions you stomp out a small flame that can turn into a greasefire if you don't check yourself.  Worrying is a disease of the mind I think. If you think prematurely that the girl will never like you, that your not worthy, or you don't have a chance that becomes a self fufilling prophecy.  What that means is that whatever self image you have of yourself eventually becomes a reality because you react to what your mind tells you (my psych class helps after all ).  It will show in the way you talk, your body language, in short your belief system becomes one of a loser.I read an experiment in my social psych class that its true that people with high self esteem remember more positive information about themselves, whereas people with lower self esteem remember more negative things about themselves.  Its funny, people who had high self esteem, overrated how well they did when they performed tasks.  They actually thought they exceeded their expectations.  People with low self esteem of course did the opposite.  So if you have no prospects, no numbers, remember all the fine girls who had in the past, or even do something you do well. If you let negative emotions interfere it will colour your thoughts.  You might overreact to something a girl does to you, because you think negatively about yourself and/or your chances with her. "Recently studies have found that people who are the most well liked also have a firm handle on their emotions.  It isn't that they internalize all their negative feelings.  Instead, they shift attention away from distressing stimuli toward positive aspects of the situation.  In other words, they have excellent coping skills."This goes along with the above.  The main thing here is thinking positive.  I read in Muscular Development magazine that guys who think more postively than others have higher testosterone! That's a perfect example of how our bodies react to our thoughts.  If your in a spiral of bad thoughts, think about postive things about the situation.  "Are there hotter, finer looking girls out there?" (of course there is ). "Is she someone I want to talk o ?" "I'm going to find a girl way better that her!"etc.7)Defuse Disagreements"As people gain social competence, they try to accommodate the needs of both parties.  managing social conflict without aggression requires, listening, communicating-arguing, persuading-"Don't be aggressive with girls it doesn't work. On the other end, don't take s**t from them either.  Be assertive, that means expressing what you feel but respecting their opinion.  Do it in the form of 'I' statements like, "I don't like what you did".  Don't say." Your making me mad".  You are responsible for your emotions, not her, and by expressing it this way you show your an strong individual.  No girl (or anyone for that matter) can disrespect you unless you give them permission.  Say it in a firm voice, don't yell or scream, and don't talk under your voice like youv'e seen a ghost.  Stand upright, speak clearly, evenly, look her directly in the eye and make your feelings and intentions known.  In short, be a man.8)Laugh A Little"Humour is the single most prized social skill""There's no recipe for creating a sense of humour.  {Just)Try to see the lighter side of the situation"If you get a girl laughing, believe me, you have got her! Trust me I know.  If you don't think your that funny, try self deprecating humour.  What it is simply, is making fun of yourself lighly.  I've read so and tried it and girls love it.  It shows that you don't take yourself too seriously.  I had an old car and I told thi girl,"I'm afraid of leaving it outside on garbage day"   Making all kinds of jokes.  It also opens the door on teasing the girl too.  Be careful doing this when you first meet a girl, because it might give off the impression that you don't think much of yourself.  Also, being funny is a state of mind.  Don't take life too seriously, and don't take yourself too seriously.  That's the secret of being funny (if you don't think your too funny).Also if something bad happens that's a great opportunity.  As bad as it sounds, pain sometimes makes great comedy."Know your limits to exceed your limits"                                -Aesop Rock------------------Eyes are the window to the soulA winner says"It may be difficult but its possible"A loser says,"It may be possible but its too difficult"

    <h3>
    FAKING WARMTH 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


FAKING WARMTHIts been said that warmth is the # 1 quality a man must acquire if he wants to ease the soreness of his wrist and start using his hips.In the initial stages of courtship, challenge will get you nowhere. You have to meet women first and charm them (make them taste the bait).Warmth is nothing more than the ability to make people feel that they matter to you, and yet, few people seem to get it. Once and for all, get this : WARMTH is not sexual, or sleazy ; its light and pleasant. So theres no need to come on all hot and heavy. The trick is to come on with all the friendliness and fun at your disposal . Even the most uptight biatches will find it hard to react fearfully or angrily to someone who makes them feel loved and appreciated. Because most of us were culturally brainwashed to equate happiness with approval, we just love to feel appreciated (go ask a squirrel if he likes to feel appreciated by his peers.)Warmth is the reason why Danny De Vito gets laid. Lack of warmth is probably the reason why you dont.For those of you who dont seem to know how to be genuinely warm (and you are legion, or else this forum wouldnt be so popular), I can teach you how to fake it. If you are recluse, if few people like you, if you feel that our modern world is cold and that people are suspicious and fearful, you dont know how to be warm.  Listen to this : THE MEANING OF YOUR COMMUNICATION IS THE RESPONSE IT GETS. I repeat : THE MEANING OF YOUR COMMUNICATION IS THE RESPONSE IT GETS.WARMTH IS THE KEY.Use this technique and within a few minutes women who were absolute strangers will be laughing at your silliest jokes and punching you playfully.In a nutshell, here it is : Act as if the women you meet were long lost, unattractive school mates that you dearly loved.Believe me, if you keep desire in check, you can make a woman feel loved and special just by the warmth in the tone of your voice and your smile. You might have guessed it already, bursting your pants with a mighty hard on wont help you to exude warmth. In fact, desire does to charisma what a 300 lbs gay culturist does to the new guy on his fist visit to the prisons showers : no good. I know the metaphor is very poorly chosen, but it is nevertheless a powerful image. Desire makes you either insecure or lustful. It kills your chances before you even open your mouth.Why is it that you can fake warmth when talking your old grand daddy or sound genuinely nice to your friends dog ? Thats right, youre not picturing yourself pounding them like a maniac while making a conversation (assuming your sexual fantasies arent that exotic. But who knows.)So dont worry about your tone of voice, facial expression or physiology. Unless you're a splendid comedian, faking a facial expression will not serve your cause. Lets face it : you cant act. It will be a lot easier to fake warmth by changing how you represent what you see.This means eliminating desire at its root. So if this means masturbating three times in a row and punching yourself in the crouch before you get out of the house (for the eternal bachelors only), do it. However there is a simpler answer : when talking to a beautiful lady, pretend you alredy have someone in your life, pretend you are talking to your sister, pretend she is in fact a very feminine boy, whatever it takes.When this is done, just pretend shes a long lost friend  and be interested in whats happened to her.I know what youre thinking : I cant be that nice to strangers what am I gonna look like Im not like that. Its not my style.Thats right, youre not like that and you are BORING.Think of the person you could become. See a warm, charming individual who listens to what people have to say (a rare commodity these days). Now compare that person to the boring you, the one who dodges other peoples eyes and says : i know who loves me, all the other people can  eat my shorts. You are probably right, a lot of people deserve to eat your shorts and aren't in the least bit interesting, but who would you rather be : a bitter, unexciting punk or a unique soul who persists in reaching out for other people ?Warmth is the doorstep.------------------Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.- RooseveltHeretics shall perish.

    <h3>
    Kino makes all the difference 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


I have made what I consider to be a remarkable breakthrough in my development as a DJ.  For the longest time I underestimated the importance of what we call kino.  I made some attempts at it, but didn't make it much of a priority.  After my experience on a date yesterday not only is kino a priority now, it is THE priority.I had set up a brief, low-key first date for drinks with a girl I had met at a dance club quite some time ago.  We had had some phone conversations by then but hadn't seen each other since we met.  As far as conversation goes, it was like most dates of this type for me.  One of my main problems on dates in the past has been gaging the interest level.  I was able to do it this time with some really simple kino techniques.When a pause came up in the conversation I slowly reached across the table and clasped my hand around hers.  I stroked her palm from underneath as I complemented a ring she was wearing.  She seemed quite welcoming me touching her hand, I took this as a sign of a good interest level.As the date continued I was thinking "the hair is next, I got to get my hands in her hair somehow!"  We were at a non-smoking bar, so when the date was getting ready to end she asked if I would like to come have a cigarette with her which I did.  I stood pretty close to her while we were smoking and I reached up by her temple and preened her hair back around her ear and said "that's a really nice earing."  The thanked me for the compliment and again seemed to like the touch.  Not long after that we said good bye.  Her pupils were a little dialated and she initiated a hug turning her face against mine.  I kept the hug brief as I said goodbye.This kino stuff is not nearly as complicated as I made it out to be in my head and so incredibly effective in gaging interest level and turning her on.  I guess I just had to start doing it.  Now I know that it's all about kino.------------------Look out for number one and don't step in number two![This message has been edited by trickynick (edited 03-27-2002).]

    If you think she's playing games/mixed signals 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Seem to be alot of posts on mixed signals and game playing from women. This is what I have found will stop it cold: Walk awayIt may sound obvious or redundant but I know that even when I was acting DJish some girls will still try and manipulate you, especially the hot ones. It amazes me the power some women "think" they have over us. I know this to be true, and it's men's fault. Most men will try and try again with a woman until she just bites his head off. Most girls, the hot ones for sure, really think that they can have thier cake and eat it too. They don't think you have the guts to walk off, they think you'd never do that. I believe they think that as long as you think you may have any chance at all with them, you'll remain accesible. As a matter of fact, I know this.Thus they feel comfortable playing games and making you wait around. Walk away and they cannot believe it, blows their mind. It shows them all the traits they want in a man. Don't let her toy with you, life is too short.The last girl that was trying to manipulate me is beautiful and knows it. She was interested in me but would not do what needed to be done for us to be together. I'll just say that she was trying to "have her cake and eat it too". Now she knew I was interested, and that she was hot, so she thought she could get away with murder, so to speak. She never dreamt I'd say to hell with and move on. But I did, and I'm damn proud of it. And she was crushed. It still amazes me how much girls hate to lose when they are trying to manipulate or get something from a guy. The real hot ones have probably never had a guy walk away, ever. So they have themselves on a pedestal. If you walk away because she isn't "playing fair", it destroys that pedestal, and her fantasy land is replaced by a big slap in the face, a dose of what men deal with daily from women: Pain, reality, rejection, loss.I think that the act of a guy walking away is our ultimate weapon. You must be willing to do this. Women can do it easily, because getting dates or sex for them is a given, unless they are ugly as hell. They know the power in it. Most guys won't use this power, or don't realize they have it. We do have it, and it does all come down to confidence. I think alot of guys here aren't sure what confidence is. My description of confidence is being fine without a woman. That is the ultimate weapon to combat a woman's schemes.With the girl I mentioned all that tool place before I found this site. But I didn't care if I had a woman or not, and man how true it is that women pick up on that fast. It may not prevent them from playing games or trying to manipulate you, but it damn sure will frusrate and confuse them. With that one girl that thought I'd never walk off found out I did because she wasn't playing her cards right, trust me it stripped her of any power she "thought" she had over me. That's a good feeling and I hope others will use the power of "walking away". It is a power naturally bestowed upon an attractive woman, and they think they are the only elite group that has it. If you utilize this same power that you DO have, she sees that you have the same if not better "weapons" than she does. From then on, if she is interested, no more games or manipulation, she will be "on her toes" and attentive, likely working harder than you to salvage a chance for the two of you getting involved romantically.

The amount of times I have read a post asking this question must now be in the hundreds!I think its what we all came this forum trying to dind the answer to...How do I get girls?And then you look at some of the people here...

    Ways to make your self more attractive 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


In trying to meet chicks, I have found that a good method is to do stuff that is out of the ordinary.  For instance, always have one thing that u do differently than other guys, for me, I love to wear jewelry.  Save some cash and spring for like a movado watch. (200-300 bucks) I have had so many girls say that they love that and they realize that you have the means to buy stuff like that, they get interested.  They love jewelry and they are constantly asking me if i coudl buy them some, and I love to say, well if u were my girl i would buy u stuff like that...they love it..I have also found that a cool pair of shoes that are shiny looking can really get a girl to notice you, i guess its tha they love shoes so they check ya out when u are wearing yours.....and the best thing i have found is to act as if, just like on the movie boiler room, act as if u have a nine inch co*k, and dont take crap.   from them.  U get rejected, screw it, just go to the next one.

    <h3>
    Eliminate All Her Other Options 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Remember when you were a little tyke, and you had that one record that you played over and over and over and over, and you never got sick of it? Then, when you got older, you got your own money, you discovered shopping, and before you knew it, you had every CD you ever wanted? All of a sudden, instead of having only one album, you had fifty, a hundred, or a thousand choices. You want to play some music, but you sit there for ten minutes deciding which CD to pop in. Then, when you start listening, you get bored real quick, because you're thinking of the other CDs in your collection, and all the other songs you could be listening to. So you take out this CD in mid-song, and throw another in there.Okay, so here's this little girl. Mommy and Daddy put the idea into her head that some day, Mr. Right will come into her life and sweep her off her feet. She meets a little boy, and she likes him. She pulls his hair, and punches him in the mouth a lot because she's really into him. One day he gives her a kiss on the cheek, and after that, it's all she can think about. She's found her first love. He's Mr. Right. She's imagining the wedding in her head, down to the last detail. She knows how many kids they're going to have, what he's going to do for a living, she even knows what color the curtains are. This little boy is the man she's going to spend the rest of her life with.Then she starts growing tits.Now every boy in school is into her. They're all drooling over her, snapping her bra strap, trying to mack on her. She gets into high school, and her body is developing. The boys are all jerking off at night, thinking about her, and desperately trying to get into her pants. She realizes that the boy she once loved is not the only option now. He's like that old, scratched-up record she never plays anymore. She can choose between many boys, but she can never decide which one she really likes. So she tries one out for awhile, but she gets to thinking about all the other ones demanding her attention, and she gives another one a spin. Then another, then another... Before long, she's getting ruthless. She's a grown adult now, and for several years she's had the male gender eating out of the palm of her hand. She can pretty much get whatever she wants from a guy, and whatever one guy can't provide, there's another guy who can. But she's getting bored with it. Men aren't a challenge to her, so she keeps going through her collection, trying to find the one that will stir something in her.I don't buy as many Cds as I used to, but every now and then, I find one that I love, and I play it over and over and over and over. Why? I have so many to choose from. Why do I keep playing this one particular CD?Because something stands out about it. It's not the typical music. There's something unique about it that you can't get from listening to any other CD. For awhile at least, whenever I want that certain feeling, that CD is the only place it comes from.Back to our girl. Here she is, smack in the middle of her boring, contemptuous, manipulative existence, and then you walk in the door. At first she thinks nothing of you. Either you're going to be shy and not talk to her or make eye contact, or you're going to ogle her and try to impress her, showing your desperation. She's so used to not being challenged by any man that she doesn't have the slightest clue what's in store for her.You make great eye contact. You talk clearly and powerfully to her. In the presence of others, you're not afraid to speak your mind. You smile and touch her confidently, and show a sense of humor. Nothing seems to bother you. She senses that you're attracted to her, but she gets the feeling that you could turn around and walk out that door, never seeing her again, and you wouldn't care.Ever borrow your favorite CD to a friend? Remember how much you wanted it back? You call your buddy, but the a$$hole's never home. You want to hear that music again.Then the punk moves to Hong Kong, and he took your favorite CD with him! You go to the store to find another copy of that CD, and you find out it was a rare limited edition, and they won't be getting any more. So now you're prowling around the used CD stores and looking on eBay, and after a painful period of time, you finally find another copy. All your other CDs get stepped on and scratched, and loaned out, but this one...THIS ONE... nobody touches. You treasure it more than any other one in your collection. You've learned your lesson. You will not take it for granted again.So now you've made an impression on the woman. But you disappear for awhile. During this time, she still has her little collection of men, but she doesn't really want to play them. Time is passing, and she can only think about the unique feelings you stir inside her. She begins thinking that maybe you have a collection of your own, and she is going to have to do something to really stand out in your mind. But this is what's going on with all the other women in your collection. They become frustrated that they're not the only ones, and they throw themselves at you.You become bored. Women aren't a challenge to you anymore, so as your collection grows, you find yourself going through it more and more, trying to find the one that stirs something inside you.You used to be an AFC, and are now a DJ. She used to be a DJ, and you have reduced her to what you once were.Think about what bores you. Why are you bored? Because these things offer nothing unique. Why don't we get excited about daily chores? Because we do them daily. Why is a trip to Florida exciting? Because you're not there everyday. Unless you live in Florida, in which case you take it for granted. It's no big deal.Corporations know that, in order to make you buy what they're selling, they have to stand out in some way. If every potato chip was the same in every way that matters, you wouldn't be loyal to any one brand, you would go for whatever brand was on the shelf as you pass by. People love "new" things. Frito Lay comes out with a new chip, and eventually people realize it's just a Dorito cut into the shape of a star, with some powdered sugar on it. But by that point, they've already sold us thirty million bags. Just the perception of something being new and unique is enough to make humans crave it. We always talk about being confident, and limiting our availability, and not taking any crap from women, and these techniques work. But why do they work? Because women are treated the same way by men, day in, day out, and they're used to it. They're bored out of their skulls. They're looking for someone to act in a new and exciting way, to awaken them from their miserable existence. They have so many options, but they're all like recycled pop songs. They have nothing new to offer.Then, just like that new CD with the style of music you can't get anywhere else, you offer her something different. She wants to feel that music over and over again.She has a world of options. If you're just like all the rest, how can you blame her if she discards you like a CD that she can just go out and buy another copy of? Be unique, excite her with your confidence and individuality, and you'll be the only real option for her.------------------"Honesty may be the best policy, but it's important to remember that, apparently, by elimination, dishonesty is the second best policy.

    <h3>
    Casanova's Guide to Humor 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


I will allow the mods to beat the everlasting piss out of me later, since this is really more of a tip than anything else, but I know this topic has been discussed here and I wanted to ensure that it gets seen.  Today we're going to talk about humor.  Humor is one of the biggest, most important DJ skills.  If you have humor, it easily leads to the other skills and traits you want to cultivate as a DJ, such as a positive attitude, confidence, and a general aura of being "fun."  Luckily, a sense of humor can be refined and developed, and it can be learned.  I'm going to try to teach you a few of the basics.BE OBSERVANTKeep your eyes open and look around.  There is plenty of funny stuff going on constantly, if you are just open enough to look for it.  Look for things that are out of place, embarassing things that other people are doing, or anything that just doesn't seem "right".  Such as going to the mall and seeing a "Dress Barn" store, and then next door, seeing a "Dress Barn for Women" store.  Makes you think.  Read, watch, or listen to some George Carlin for more examples of this... he's one of the best.EDUCATE YOURSELFHumor and intelligence often go hand-in-hand.  Keep up-to-date on world current events.  Read the newspaper, watch the news.  So often, you will read about or see something in the news that will give you plenty of material for humor.  For example, your girlfriend has a lot of shoes.  You can say, "Damn you've got a lot of shoes."  Or you can say, "Jesus, did Imelda Marcos move in without anyone telling me?"  This is also why Jay Leno, David Letterman, and Jon Stewart use the news for laughs, to great success.  Also, having a good vocabulary helps a lot.  Word choice is important to humor.  Some words are funnier than others.  BE SPECIFICWhen you're making fun of something, and you will often make comparisons or talk about other objects.  Use specific examples and name brands.  For example, if you're getting asked a million questions by a girl, just say, "What is this, a freakin' Starbucks?"  Remember, there's a big difference between "We went shopping" and "She couldn't pry herself out of The Gap."BE HAPPYWhile depressed and sour people might be fun to laugh at, they aren't funny.  Smile, laugh, and enjoy yourself.  People will see you as fun-loving and cheerful and the humor will flow much better.DO THE UNEXPECTEDHumor is all about shattering expectations, surprising people, and exaggeration.  Jack Handey is a pro at this.  Take a look at one of his quotes:  "I hope someday, if I ever become rich and famous, that I'm not mean to poor people, like I am now."  The first part, before the comma, is expected.  The second part is the surprise, and it's what makes the quote funny.  With a little practice, anyone can be funny.  Take a look at what the masters do, but don't copy them.  Work on your observation, your attitude, and your ability to be unpredictable, and you'll be among the funniest people around.------------------CASANOVA"You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you."Eric Hoffer"I may disagree with what you have to say, but I shall defend, to the death, your right to say it."Voltaire"Before we set our hearts too much upon anything, let us examine how happy those are who already possess it."Francois de La Rochefoucauld

    The Ultimate Kino Guide 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Ultimate Kino GuideFor the longest time I underestimated the importance of what we call kino. Trickynick posted 12-17-2001Kino, a powerful and misunderstood tool in the DJ arsenal. To better understand this foreign concept I searched the DJ forum like a man on a mission. I searched over 300 threads to bring you (but mainly myself) the Ultimate Kino guide, written by the masters (and a little by me too).What is Kino? On the board kino is referred to as non-sexual touching. Is it non-sexual? Not hardly. A better definition is affectionate touching, but for those new to Kino, think of it as non-sexual until it becomes second nature.Lexomatic posted 10-12-2001    quote:Kino is one of my favorite DJ techniques, because it bypasses a lot of the verbal crap when talking to women. The best kino areas for me are the arm and the back for 'first contact' situations, and the hands and the top of the upper legs for more 'intimate' touches. The trick is in the timing and the duration. The easiest is to use it as an extension of a request as in: [stand within arm's reach of a girl you want to ask out to lunch]"Hey [reach out and touch upper arm], feel like a quick bite to eat for lunch?" [release touch]As a tool it can be used to indicate your sexual interest in a girl and to gage her interest in you.Pook posted 11-06-2000 quote:There is a single purpose for Kino: to show that you are a Sexual Being. Light touching on the arms, shoulders, upper back, forces her to think sexually about you and gives her permission to touch you similarly or to up the ante. Girls LOVE Kino. KINO-INTIATION TesuqueRed posted 12-09-2001   quote:Women mark territory (i.e., you) by touch. You can do this too.Who initiates that first touch, thus breaking that personal space barrier? Girls are freer with kino, freely touching their friends and others they may have a stronger desire in (thats you stud). Some say let the girl be the first to initiate it, while others say the DJ should. At first I was inclined to say the woman should. But after reading the pros and cons in this thread http://www.sosuave.com/ubb/Forum10/HTML/000033.html  I have to side on, let the DJ be the one. Some worry that you might scare off a girl by initiating kino first. Nonsense. If she is in to you this will not turn her off. Second, the DJ goes for what he wants. He is not passive in this quest. Letting the girl come to you is passive. Be active. If she was turned off, she never liked you and you never had a chance with her. You just did yourself a favor by finding out ASAP.DarkDream (who doesnt use kino) posted 01-12-2002  quote: there are some specific reasons I don't use kino. For one, most AFCs give a woman *way* too much kino and even do it when it is unwarranted. Touching a woman (too) frequently can turn her off and more importantly *inhibit* her touching you.Dont dismiss DarkDream totally, there is truth to what he says. Pro-KinoDr_Feelgood posted 08-13-2001  quote:I read an article in Men's Health written by a woman. She said guys need to touch women as early as the first date. It lets them know you're into them.I think how women view it varies depending on the woman. I often touch a girl first and w/ positive results. Just to see her reaction, I mean an innocent touch like on the arm or back and lightly and quickly. If she seems repulsed, I move on, forget her.I do this even if I don't know the girl or before we ever date. I was at a party recently and touched a girl on the back to nudge her forward so I could get to the keg. We had never seen each other before. After that I could see her checking me out and showing interest, she wasn't before I touched her. We ended up making out that night and have gone out 3 times since then, and now I'm expecting to fukk her on the next date. Pook  posted 11-06-2000 quote:If you do not initiate Kino and wait for her to do it, you are Mr. Nice Guy. This is what Nice Guys do and why they lose. They are too 'nice' and think that touching a girl will 'scare' her or show that he is too interested (by touching her it tells her that you are interested in her sexually).Failure to do this will land you right into the "Let's Just Be Friends Zone. The girl will see you as a nice personality but sexually as a mannequin. Why? Because mannequins don't initiate Kino.Even my 'nice guy' friends, when they started initiating Kino, had full relationships BLOSSOM practically overnight. Kino is that powerful.You TEST the girl's interest by doing Kino and seeing how she responds.Kino is the Ultimate Interest Test. You can tell if a girl is just 'playing', 'teasing', being a 'professional dater' or truly interested by how she responds to the Kino. If she opens up her posture, mirrors your touch, etc. then she is interested and attracted to you SEXUALLY. (This is why Kino is said to be the first true step of the courtship ritual.)If you WAIT for her to Kino first, you will:  A.) Spend more money and time taking her on dates waiting for her to initiate Kino (She's waiting for THE MAN to initiate it, just as you initiated the courtship by asking for her number.) and  B.) Eventually landing in "Friend" zone.Failure to initiate Kino = Nice GuyHOW TO KINODarkDream posted 02-02-2002  quote:Kino, at first, should be almost imperceptible and should fit the situation.Pre-Kino  invading their personal space. For those who are timid about using kino, start with the pre-kino. DarkDream (who doesnt use kino) does what I call, pre-kino. posted 01-12-2002  quote:I do kino in a non-touching way. How is this possible? Simple. When we are both laughing for instance, I'll lean my body close to hers, or invade her personal space at opportune moments. This type of kino I do without reservation.If she is cool with you then she wont step back or react negatively.Then there is the outright touching. At first it must be almost imperceptible, subtle, casual, on some sub conscience level. This is the key. Its not overtly outright where she or anyone else would really notice.bclarke675 posted 12-08-2001  quote:To start with kino, go for light brushes or touches of the hand, arm, shoulder or back. The arm and hand touches are the safest, are least likely to be offensive. Use these touches as you're talking, to emphasize a point or elicit a response from her. The touch should be in passing and not linger more than a second. In the hand touch, if she responds and holds your hand, don't pull away, go with it. Get bolder as time goes on. Try to stay non-sexual with your touches until she initiates a sexual touch.After you touch her, judge her reaction. If she touches you or smiles then you know your touch was acceptable and you can continue to use kino. Increase the frequency of your touches and move a little closer to share some personal space. Lexomatic posted 10-12-2001 quote:Women who casually touch you when you converse with them. You should take this as a sign that she is interested in you (at least at that point, anyways  ) and that you are making progress with her. Yes she may just one of those few touchy types, but why assume that when the odds are in your favor that she isn't.If she reacts badly, like pulling away, opening a larger area of personal space between you two, or spraying you with mace and then kicking you in the balls, then chances are your kino was unwelcomed, too early, too clumsy, or she is just not interested in you. Actions speak louder than words. However, no damage is really done, so dont worry about it. In fact you just did yourself a favor and found out what her interest really is. My advice would be to thank her for an interesting conversation and then move on. You can always come back and gage her interest gain after she sees you woo others with your DJ skills.TesuqueRed posted 12-09-2001 quote:Touching is synonymous with "affection" to a woman. Check out the negative side of that: one way she expresses dislike for someone is to react with disgust at the thought of touching or being touched by a that person. This is why you pay attention to the reaction you get when you inadvertently or intentionally touch her. Sharpen your awareness by practicing it. Keep in mind her reaction could be a read on her personality (she's uptight, etc.) rather than a reflection on you.TAG YOUR IT  KINODonJoey posted 01-21-2002  quote:Basically, use any chance you get to start kino no matter how trivial a situation you're in...even talking about going bald.At this point you have developed a rapport with your target. You feel comfortable touching each other. Now its time to take it up a notch. This is Tag youre it, Kino or The Ante Up. You touch her, she touches you. You touch her back, she touches you back, etc.  If things are going well and she is interested in you sexual, this is when you are going to find out. Eventually you two should be getting very sexual with your touches. But this is a slow process, which may take several hours as you two get to know each other and get more confident around each other. An example of the progression from non-sexual to sexual kino is as follows. An innocent or accidental brush of the hands. A point is made and you touch her arm to cement that point, you share a moment. She touches your arm and laughs. You excuse yourself to the restroom and as you scoot by her you place you hands on her hips. When you come back you place one hand on her and you brush by. She leans into you as you do it. You sit down, her touch is freer. She places her hand on your arm a bit longer than she really needs to, but she wants to tell you about something funny she saw or thought of while you were gone. When she is done she removes her hand and stares into your eyes. You let that silence hang in the air as you digest what she told you. You smoothly place your hand over hers, in effect lightly pinning it to the table and say, Lets go somewhere more blah, blah, blah, and then you look away (hand still on hers) and call the waiter over. The point is made and you remove your hand. In this scenario, you can see many examples of Kino and how at first it is imperceptible and then moves to the more and more obvious and sexual.De La Soul posted 04-06-2002  quote:Smile. Eye Contact. Kino. Killer Instinct. Done Deal. GETTING COMFORTABLE USING KINOTread softly, but use it with every woman you know or meet. You may get awkward reactions at first, from girls you already know, because they are not use to you using Kino with them. If your use of Kino is correctly done and is imperceptible then this awkwardness will be reduced to a very short period.Maranathaman posted 10-04-2001  quote:Now repeat after me, "I WILL do KINO on every cute girl I meet from now on"This frequent use of Kino will prepare you for when you use it on your next seduction attempt. bclarke675 posted 12-02-2001 quote:The way I got myself more comfortable with kino was by casually touching women I was interested in on the shoulder or back while I was passing them to get somewhere in a club, especially if it's crowded. Also reaching over and touching their hand or arm when making a funny point helps. It just adds emphasis and makes the joke more personal (a shared feeling).If you find the woman's hair attractive, you can go for the hair touch, but keep in mind that this is also the beginning of the "kiss test", so you should have built some rapport with her before making this move. If she'll let you lean into her hair or ear, you're probably to that point. Also, if you're seeing someone you've seen before, but aren't close with, a gentle handshake (almost a hand hold) is a good way to go. Character posted 12-02-2001  quote:I never used kino or wasn't really flirtatious, so even if I wanted to be people would be thinkin, "Why is Character touching her?", so I always shyed away from it. In order for me to end this way of thinking I needed to slightly change my rep. This means being touchy-feely with the girls regardless of whether you are interested in them, so when you do want to use kino on the girl you're interested in you won't feel weird about it. When in convo with any girl USE KINO! Any girl, best friends, random friends, you're momma, grandma, etc... Just do it! While talking with em touch em, when you're in a playful mood, tease them and they will reciprocate and maybe lightly hit you, then you can just do the same back and it will continue for a lil while in a playful manner, when you go to sit down and talk to em sit right near em and don't be afriad to sit too close (just don't over do it). Just practice alot. Try not to limit the kino to just a few girls but most of your friends. Also when you see a girl friend of yours enter a party or gathering or whatever give them a welcome hug. When they leave, give them a good-bye hug. Don't forget to do this with all the girls so that it's expected of you and it wouldn't seem weird at all. You will be experienced with kino and the girls will love your touch. EXAMPLES OF KINOTHIAGO BRAZIL posted 12-08-2001   quote:Since I have been introduced to KINO techniques, touching people, especially girls, and business situations when I need to be trusted, my success improved more than 100%.Kino examples quote:A good one is to say "You've got something in your hair" while you brush her hair with your hand. You can then run your hand to her shoulder and down her arm as part of the brushing motion. You neg her and get kino (brushing her hair with your hand is something that you would do if you were dating her, so it's good) in one play.Shiftkey posted 01-31-2002 quote:Some flirty kino things I've noticed myself doing to girls are bumping into her, purposely blocking her way, touching her shoulder to say hello or good bye, putting little pieces of trash in her back pocket (seriously!), touching the back of her neck when my hands are cold, touching her waist or shoulders when passing her, poking, and tickling. I used to be the same way as you. But I started making an effort to do kino, slowly at first, and now it's definitely a part of my personality.Trickynick posted 12-17-2001 quote:When a pause came up in the conversation I slowly reached across the table and clasped my hand around hers. I stroked her palm from underneath as I complemented a ring she was wearing. She seemed quite welcoming me touching her hand, I took this as a sign of a good interest level.I stood pretty close to her while we were smoking and I reached up by her temple and preened her hair back around her ear and said, "That's a really nice earring." The thanked me for the compliment and again seemed to like the touch.T Dog originally posted here quote:When a girl shows you her tattoo or belly button ring, reach out and gently stroke it. Jester posted 02-06-2002 quote:Play keep away, take something from her, and make her chase after u to get it back. Of course, you should block her so she has to jump on you to get it.Got this one from Seinfeld, IF YOU KNOW THE GIRL, try feeling the fabric of her shirt and guess what it is.And of course, theres always tickling.KINO  REVERSALThe reversal is the opposite effect that Kino has on women.If you are really good, and a girl is really into you then by not Kino-ing a girl you can raise her interest level. Freewill posted 04-29-2002 quote:Once you know the girl, and start to get her interested in you, this is kind of a way to play hard to get. She's interested in you, and you deprive her of physical contact (you have to have used kino effectively previously before this can work). Therefore, because she CAN'T HAVE the physical contact, she desires it. So SHE initiates double the contact to try to get your attention. As I say, its a means of playing hard to get.Also, as said before, kino is the Ultimate interest test.TesuqueRed posted 12-09-2001 quote:Touching is synonymous with "affection" to a woman.

She gives all the buy signs, but she is not for sell. Luckily this is only about 10% of the girls that give kino.Keymaster of Goza posted 12-27-2001 quote:Ahh yes, the old "Sunshine Girl trap". There's only one way to know for sure.1.You ask for her home number.2. You ask her for a date.3. You do some kino then move in to kiss her. If you succeed at step 3 then you know she likes you. If she rejects step 3, you've got a Sunshine Girl on your hands. At this point you pleasantly say "Goodbye, it was fun" and never call or set up a date with her again. Any other move is a further step to the gates of misery.ON MISSING OPPORTUNITIES crowes22 posted 01-22-2002 quote:I missed a lot of opportunities by not being sexual, thinking it was rude. I don't think you have to talk sex, can if you want, but it can backfire. I prefer kino, it works wonders I think. With it you can avoid talking sex and maybe offending while you have still let the girl know you wanna fukk, very important, I wanna kick myself for not letting some know I wanted to fukk, won't happen again though. These days I let them know I wanna fukk and don't pursue, let them chase, then fukk.[This message has been edited by T Dog (edited 05-08-2002).][This message has been edited by T Dog (edited 05-08-2002).]

    How to be a better conversationalist 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Have a real curiosty to find out about the person in front of you, that's #1. The mind is full of thot's & dreams, how can U not find things to talk about? This perplexes me to no end when people say they can't think of things to talk about with chicks. The funnest part is to get into their little heads & open up all those closed drawers & just let the thot's come tumbling out like so many clothes that she has not tried on in ages. Ya they still fit & it feels good to get them out & try them on for size. U make her feel good by letting her do that. #2, be a good listener & hear what she is saying, this will lead to numerous topics to discuss. U pick up the topic thread, U lead, she follows.#3, Intrique her, make her think, ask "daring" & "silly" questions like, "how would U feel if U were standing here in your underwear talking to me" Whatever..just open up the topic & make her laugh about it.#4, Ask about her opinions on the: present situation, her clothes, her work, her hobbies, her likes & dislikes, kissing, sex, food, whatever! There are a million topics, the future, dreams, the past, family, relationships, sports ad-nauseum.#5 Have fun & it will all work out my friends. Think of yourself as a talk show host, keep it going & also let there be moments of silence, goad her to start a topic by clamming up for 20 or 30 seconds, see where she leads it to, this will tell U a lot about her. If she says nothing this also tells U a lot about her, U gotta elicite more convo. If she is totally devoid of initiating convo she is either not interested in U or she is a bimbo with no neronal connections to speak of. If that is the case then fluff her & go for Kino & the close. #6, Let her respond & do most of the talking, you just prep her & let her go, she'll take care of most of the words, U come in when U need to & keep it rolling along. Poet------------------Action is all....words don't mean shit.Trust your instincts & nothing else.

    Anything...except for NO! 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


It's hard for many girls to say the word NO!!!It's succinctness appears to be too much for many of them to handle...mainly cause they think they are going to hurt YOU (which is probably true in most cases). So next time you hear anything other than "YES" please remember these words and save your precious time and money.Yes = green light (maintain velocity and direction kind sir)No = red light (STOP right there buddy; come to a screeching halt. If you procede the cops will be after you, or you are likely to have an accident)Excuse = amber light procede with extreme caution: remember you still have to cross a busy intersection and it is highly likely that it'll change red on the way through. If it does please see NO!Don't live your life in the uncertainty of the orange light, it may turn red at any time!AD always says this, but I heard some great excuses a girl gave my mate the other night so I thought I'd emphasise it with a post. By the way we moved on a scored some other girl for him.Cheers.[This message has been edited by Peak (edited 08-13-2000).]

    Conversation To Her Heart 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


CONVERSATION:1.  First, vision your seduction more powerful than her's. Be down & prepared for whatever.2.  Talk about FEELINGS. "how was your weekend?, what did you do? did you have fun? i like the way your hair is?" - anything that you think she would like to talk about.3.  never, ever, ever, ever, ever analyse her problem's. when she start's bytching or complaining about something, dont tell her how to solve it. just listen & sympathize with her. agree with her.4.  question & description's. (ask "what...?", "have you ever...?", & "how do you FEEL...?" question's).5.  question her on the same subject. stick to the same subject. dont ramble of different question after different question's. if she tell's you about her trip to Hawaii, ask a bunch of Hawaii question's, or question's on vacation's or whatever related. your object is to let her know you're listening to her. that she can trust telling you whatever. if she trust's you enough, she'll probably change the subject to SEX. dont be bashful now.6.  rephrase whatever she say's & feed it back to her. "so you think i should cut my hair", "so, you believe he did it", whatever.7.  trees have branches & conversation has topic's. pick a word she say's and go from there. "my girlfriend Sharon told me that I should do some modeling before I go into the Army". Topic's she gave you: 1)Sharon 2) Modeling 3)The Army8.  open up her answer: HER: "i like a guy who's muscular. YOU (skinny & all): "how does a guy with muscles make you feel". Her: "he makes me feel protected". She does'nt neccesarily want a guy with muscles but a guy who makes her feel protected. you can do that skinny guy.(O.K., now that you know her, time to flip tha script on her - not on the first date of course)9.  MIND GAMES:  question her judgement on thing's. challenge her facts & figures. plant doubt in her mind. (all in fun of course). nothing negative thou.10.  if you got yourself a 9 or a 10, hit her (not physically) with a negative remark like: you got a big belly, what's wrong with you hair, how long have you had them shoes. if she start's to break down, confort her & tell her you was just kiddin. good luckATNAATNAATNAATNAATNAATNAANTA

    Pimpology 101: The Conversation 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


The Conversation - Part I: The introductionThe introduction of the conversation is very important in creating a good first impression; opening up the conversation strong is key. Delivering an introduction breaks the ice and puts you into a position to start asking questions and increasing the rapport. I recommend using these 3 introductions/approaches:1) Hi whats your name?Her saying her name is your cue to extend your hand, once you make hand contact say:Its nice to meet you <her name>. .my name is <name>.If anything stands out or is unusual about her, now is your chance to drop a compliment. If there is absolutely nothing you can comment/compliment on, then you dont necessarily have toif youre a beginner I recommend skipping this part initially. TIP: if you observe her, the situation, and the surroundings before approaching, you wont have to come up with something right on the spot after saying your name. 2) Hi my name is <name>.She should give you her name at this pointif not, then ask after a brief pause:Whats your name?.Her name is your cue to extend your hand, once you make hand contact say:Its nice to meet you <her name>.Then look to slip in a comment/compliment.3a) Hi.If she says hi and/or smiles at you, then continue from:Whats your name?3b) Hi.If she says hi and/or smiles at you, then comment/compliment on something about her.If she says thanks and/or smiles at you, then continue from:Whats your name?3c)  *Dont say hi *Comment/compliment on something about herIf she says thanks and/or smiles at you, then continue from:Whats your name?Note: Review the lesson on complimenting before using methods 3b) and 3c).Keys Points/Analysis:Shake her hand correctlyIts very important that you extend your hand at a slight angle with palm up to initiate a female type handshake in which she will respond by extending her hand with palm angled down. This will usually prevent it from turning into a formal handshake where both your hands end up vertically meeting. A formal handshake points you into the direction of the friendship zone right from the start; try your best to initiate a girl handshake. Dont hold on too longlet go once she starts letting go. You will call too much attention to the your handshake if you hold on longer than she does and it wont seem natural to her. Remember youre trying to work on her subconscious; you dont want her becoming suspicious of anything.Initiate kino (body contact) as early as possible..a simple non-threatening handshake is an excellent way of creating early kino. It also makes her feel more comfortable with you.Say her name..after saying it was nice meeting her, this works subconsciously by giving her the illusion that youre familiar with each other already.Refrain from complimenting.. during your first several approaches so youre able to get into the groove of your rap without the pressure of having to do too many things all at once. After a few dry runs, youll know when you should give one or not. Use proper eye contact .dont stare in her eyes the whole entire intro but dont look around either. Look in her eyes when asking her name..after she gives you her name, glance down for a second towards the area youll be shaking hands while extending your hand .once her hand is about to come into contact with yours, look back at her eyes and finish your intro. Conclusion:	DONT use pick-up lines The best approach is a straightforward approach; dont start off by beating around the bush. [This message has been edited by Pimpologist (edited 08-02-2001).]

The Conversation  Part II: Creating RapportThis is when you start to run serious game on her. The easiest way to create rapport is to start asking about her background. It should be done in a stylish way that makes you seem similar to her. To make her as interested in you as possible you need to make things up when you need to; this requires quick thinking, preparation, and good listening skills.I recommend starting your rap with this question:Where are you from?There are 3 possible situations:A) She lives around the area but grew up someplace elseB) Shes been living around the area all her lifeC) Shes just visiting and is from out of town*Each situation assumes youre living in an area you didnt grow up in* Running game in each scenario:A) She lives around the area but grew up someplace else:Shell give you a city, state, and/or country i.	Youve been there: Thats a nice place.I was there < days, weeks, months, years> agohow long you been living here?ii.	Youve never been there: OhIve never been there beforewhats it like over there?<she answers>how long you been living here?iii.	Youve never heard of the place: Wheres that at?..< she answers> . ..how long you been living here? Shell say: Ive been living here for < length of time>.If she says:  I dont live here, Im just visiting go directly to part C.You say: Ive been living here for < length of time> now. how you like it here?Saying how long youve been living here before asking how she likes it here will make it sound like youre not just asking questions. Your rap cant just consist of questions; you have to tell her things about yourself that are relevant to the situation as well.If she says she likes it here you say: I like it here tooits a nice place.If she says she doesnt like it here or says, Its alright you say: Yeah I knowits not really that nice around here.A good way to make yourself seem similar to her is to agree with her.B) Shes been living around the area all her life:After she tells you shes from here, ask:	You been here all your life?She will say yes, tell you she moved back from another place, or tell you shes always lived relatively in the same area. . make sure you remember this stuff so you can bring it up later in the conversation. Then say Yeahits nice being close to home Ive been living here for <time> now.Saying Yeahits nice being close to home shows her that you listened and were able to relate to her situation.C) Shes just visiting and is from out of town:She will say .. Im from <place>Im just here visiting. If she didnt mention how long she (would be/was) in town, then say: How long you here for?or How long you been here?Decide whether youll continue speaking to her based on how much longer         shell be in town.If you decide to continue running game just pick up from:Ive been living here for < time> now.how you like it here so far?* There are many variables in the beginning but theyll all eventually come together.

The Conversation  Part III: Increasing RapportNow that youve broken the ice and have started to create rapport, your next step is to increase the rapport; this is done by going a little deeper into her background. You created rapport by finding out where shes from, now in order to increase it you need to find out why shes here.I recommend continuing with these questions:A) So what brought you down here?B) So what keeps you down here?C) For this situation, the overall approach is similar but there are some slight variations that might confuse you so I recommend sticking to the women who are currently living around your area for now.There are 5 possible reasons/situations:1)	Work2)	College3)	Family4)	Friends5)	Misc.Note: How she chooses to answer this question will tell you a lot about her character and what she thinks is important.1) WorkIf she didnt tell you what she does then ask: What do you do? or So what do you do?After she answers say: Thats interestingis it fun working there? or Thats interestingdo you like working there?After she answers ask: How long you been working there?At this point she might ask what you do and/or how long you been working there.Note:Dont tell her if she doesnt ask.If she asks, its all right to tell her but dont go into detail.For example just say: Ive been working as a <occupation> for < time>.Then ask: Did you go to college? or Do you go to college?If yes then go directly to number (2).2) Collegea)	Shes currently going to college: If she didnt tell you which college then ask: What college do you go to?Then ask: Whats your major?Then ask: What are you?Then ask: How you like it so far?If you started from number (2), then continue from number (1) with: Do you work? What do you do?b) Shes already gone to college:If she didnt tell you which college then ask: What college did you go to?Then ask: What did you major in?Then ask: How long did it take you?Then ask: Did you go to graduate school?If yes then ask: Where at? then drop this subject for now after she answers.If you started from number (2), then continue from number (1) with: Do you work? What do you do?Note: 75% of the time they will reciprocate with the same questions you asked them. Be sure not to go into too much detail and dont tell her your college, major or anything else until she asks.3) FamilyIf she says family, you can be certain family is important to her. They will say something like  I came here to be closer to my family or  I have a lot of family around here.After she tells you that family is the reason why shes here or still here, dont ask her any questions about her family just yet. Just be sure to remember what she said, then go directly to number (1) starting with: So what do you do?If she doesnt work, go directly to number (2) with: Do you go to college?4) FriendsThis means that her friends are very important to her. Do exactly what you would in situation (3). Dont ask her any questions about her friends just yet. Just be sure to remember what she said, then go directly to number (1) starting with: So what do you do?If she doesnt work, go directly to number (2) with: Do you go to college?5) Misc.Occasionally you will get women who will not fall into any of the categories above. If this happens, just do exactly what you would in situations (3) and (4). Dont ask her any questions about her reason just yet. Just be sure to remember what she said, then go directly to number (1) starting with: So what do you do?If she doesnt work, go directly to number (2) with: Do you go to college?[This message has been edited by Pimpologist (edited 08-06-2001).]

The Conversation  Part V: The Pre-Calling ProcedureBefore making the call, you must follow what is known as a pre-calling procedure. It not only will guide you through the timing of each call but will also point out ways to manage and prevent common problems encountered during the first call. Preparing the first call is as important as making the first call.Timing:1) The first calls should always be made between Sunday and Wednesday.There is a very high probability shell be home Sunday thru Wednesday and a low probability shes already made plans.Day you get #: Day you make call Fri: Mon (or next Sunday)Sat: Tues (or next Sunday)Sun: Wed (or next Sunday)Mon: SunTues: SunWed: SunThur: SunSunday is the best day to make your first calls because she will almost always be home. Many girls dont go out Sunday nights because they need to rest and get ready for the week ahead. 2) The first calls should always be made at night between 9:45pm and 10:30pm.Calling at night accomplishes 4 things: i) Shes more likely to be home ii) Shes less likely to be busyiii) Shell be in a more receptive stateiv) Youll be in her mind before she goes to bed3) Never call the very next day after getting a number no matter how good looking they are or how well the approach/conversation went.When you call the very next day, shell think youre desperate and have nothing going on in your life. When you refrain from calling the next day youre telling her you have a life, your busy, and your time is important.Key Points:When you get a number on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, you can call 2 days later on the specified days above if you havent established a string of dates yet. If you already have girls lined up, dont call until the week you want to get with them. I recommend not waiting more than 3 weeks before calling. Sometimes it can be difficult to fit them all into your schedule but make sure to call within 3 weeks of getting the number. Occasionally you can call the third week and say youll call the following week (this should only be used when youve been booked for the last four weeks because it goes against additional playa tip #2).Never go more than 2 weeks without getting new numbers. Keep fresh numbers coming in so the supply never goes dry and the process continues smoothly.Additional Playa Tips:1) If she told you to call on a specific day, make sure you dont call on that day.Her: Call me (tomorrow/day of week) ok?You: OkIll try to.Dont just say: Okbecause if you dont call that day shell get the impression that you are deceitful and it will be harder to build trust. Saying youll try to call will put you in control of the situation and there wont be any hard feelings when you dont call her on that day. Call her the day after she told you to, only if it lands on one of your calling days.2) After getting a number, never say Ill give you a callThey have to wonder if you will call them or not. If you told her you were going to call her, it takes the challenge and mystery right out of you. You have to keep them guessing and thinking about your first call.3) Block your number from appearing on outgoing calls.All you have to do is call your phone company and tell them to block your number from appearing on outgoing calls. Most girls have caller ID so they know who calls, when they call, and how many times they call. When you get your number blocked, she wont be able to figure out whos calling. Note: This doesnt mean you can call more than once a day or call her everyday until you reach her, blocking your number will just add an element of mystery to the call.Troubleshooting:1) The answer machine picks up:Dont leave a message. The first time on the phone must be live.Never call back on the same night or the next night; always assume all girls have caller ID.Call back on one of the calling nights.Follow this procedure until you reach her.2) A roommate picks up and says shes not home:Roommate: Hello.You: Hi, Im calling for <her name>?At this point she might ask who you arejust answer with 3 words, This is <your name>.Roommate: Shes not here right now . (at this point she might ask who you are if she hasnt yet and/or she might say) Can I take a message?You: Well whos this?She will either tell you her name and/or tell you shes her roommate.If she didnt mention her name say: Whats your name?If she didnt mention she was her roommate say: Are you her roommate?If she hasnt asked who you are yet then say: This is <your name><name of girl you called for> (didnt mention/mentioned) she had a roommatehow long have you been living together?Roommate: <she answers>You: Oh yeah?ok well let me leave my number with you.Roommate: Ok.After your done giving her your number say: It was nice talking to you <roommates name>(pause to give her a chance to reciprocate the statement)bye.Creating a little rapport with the roommate will get you panty points with both the roommate and the girl you tried calling. Theres a good chance her roommate will put in some good words for you like He seems like a really nice guy  or  You should give this guy a call, he seems really cooletc.Note: Dont talk to the roommate too long; just enough to give her a good impression of you. Going through the above dialogue is enough.[This message has been edited by Pimpologist (edited 08-22-2001).]

      Wanna know a quick, easy, fun way to get in some panties? 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


There is a technique I've been using for years to get girls horny and wanting some **** . It is simple, easy, and fun too. All you have to do is talk about sex with them. That simple. Girls are just as horny as we are and nowadays many of them are very open about discussing their sexuality.  Let's say you got some girl that you already know and you want to move things up to the next level. Start out with a casual conversation about something funny or interesting. This will put her in a relaxed, pleasurable state of mind which is exactly what you want if you are trying to seed her mind with the idea of you two hitting the sheets. Then say something that moves the topic on to sex (don't talk about disease or pregnancy or anything like that). Be creative. Say something like you were reading a magazine and they took a poll to see which sexual positions were their readers favorites. Then make up some statistics from the poll and ask her when she has sex which positions does she like the best. Then you tell her what you like the best. Most likely, you'll find at least something you both like to do or have done. If she likes doggystyle, tell her you love it too. If she has any interest in fuccking you, she will respond to this conversation with positive signs like smiling, laughing, or she might change her body language or give more eye contact, or even start touching you. The more she is willing to talk about this and she is showing that she enjoys this, the better the chance of getting that a$$. If she is responding favorably, then you can get bolder and say, "Let me ask you a hypothetical question. If you and I had sex, do you think it would be good?" This is good because you're not directly asking her to sleep with you, you're only giving her a possible scenario for her imagination. If she says yes right away, you're in like flynn. If she says maybe with a smile and seems positive, don't take that as a no. However, if she seems offended, uncomfortable, angry, or negative in any way, just tell her you were only joking(this also means that you should leave this chick alone, period!!).If you get a yes or a positive sounding maybe, all you have to do is tell her that if she thinks it might be good, why not find out? Tell her that after all, what does she have to lose? Tell her that she should try it with you once and if she doesn't like it, you'll never ask her to do it again (HaHaHaHaHa!!!!!). Say this with a smile and look directly in her eyes.  You'll be surprised how chicks respond to shhitt like that. You're showing her confidence, a little jerkiness, and you're showing her you're a person who is unafraid to show his sexuality to her in a direct way while still being respectful(a lot of nice guys are afraid to say stuff this and come off as neutral or asexual).  It's like you're using logic to convince her that it would not only be enjoyable for her to do this, but that it is the right thing to do. Try it out and let me know what happens.

    <h3>
    Guide to Listening 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


We all know a girl wants a man who listens. A man who listens to what they say, think, feel about anything and everything. This seems like an easy objective, given that listening is a passive skill. I thought I had this covered well.Well, 2 girlfriends ago, when we broke up, she told me I never listened to her. How could this be? She called all the time, and we taked for a while. There is an inherant problem with my rebuttle. I will ease into it. You know when a girl talks, you would usually rather be somewhere else. You don't care what she thinks, because in most cases, what she thinks is wrong. Funny thing is, it reciprocates. They care about what we have to say about as much as we care about their thoughts.But it is a conversation, right? When they talk, they expect a response. They want a little input to see if we are listening, or if we are smart and have an opinion. Well, I presumed this was so. It works that way with other men, why wouldn't it work with women? Guys:"How bout them Braves?""Hell yeah. Maddux is a pimp." (etc.)Notice the agreement, and the input afterwards. I now describe correct form with women:Girls:"I'm so tired today. My parents were giving me all this crap last night, and I blah blah blah new shoes blah blah nails blah blah. I think I did the right thing."".....Yeah"Notice how I didn't comment on anything, just let the crap fly out of her lips, and agreed afterward. This alone will not take care of the situation. Although you care not what she says, it must appear that you do care. There are a few pointers you must be aware of.Always look into her eyes. This is a good thing to do in any situation. If she looks away for a second, feel free to look at any other body part, but keep them on the eyes when she looks back at you. This is not a stare. Just be relaxed, and act like she has your focus. You can think about something else if it keeps your ears from bleeding. Also, keep a light smile, or grin on, like you agree with, or enjoy what she is saying.Nod if she pauses, or say yeah. If she laughs, laugh a little with her. It hurts to fake a smile for so long, but you'll get used to it. Few guys have mastered this, less yet practice it, giving you a huge edge. One of the first thing a girl mentions in your description is "Oh and he's such a great listener."Put this into practice, but make sure you are going out with her, doing sexual things. Make sure you are not "Friends" with her, because this will only lower you down further into the friend zone. It is a powerful tool. Use it and benefit.

    Is not the idea that a person will love you for who you really are just BS? 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Somehow I got these AFC ideas in mind:"Someone will love you for who you are.""It's what is inside that really counts.""There is a right person out there for you."Is this not really just BS told to us like Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy (nice child like stories that hide the harsh facts of like from us)?What I'm getting at is that a woman really doesn't give a rat's ass (at least at first) whether you are really a good, talented, intelligent, caring, compassionate person (a good person inside).  What a woman wants is for you to make her respond *emotionally*.  Being confident, controlled and most importantly being a challenge is what a woman *emotionally* responds to.  I think she cares more that you can make her laugh rather that you work in charity organizations, are a former buddhist monk or you save peoples' lives. In reality, to be a true Don Juan you want to keep her in the dark (mysterious) as to who you are.  What you a Don Juan should do is to try as much as possible to *not* reveal anything.  Do not reveal anything about yourself or how you feel about her.  In reality, a woman will not love you for who you are: she will go ahead and get rid of you if she finds out who you are. Why? You become boring to her, she can't fantasize about you or wonder about you.The art of seduction is all about creating a mysterious image of yourself where she has no exact clue where she stands with you.  You are in effect creating a little mini drama for her to peak her interest; this is all this romance horse ****. And once her interest is peaked she will lay seige to you to find out as much as possible about you and to *destroy* you by trying to control you and demean you.  Why does she want to *destroy* you?  She wants to destroy you because she wants to find out if her interest is justified (I believe woman hate to repond emotionally to someone -- remember they think themselves as princesses and showing any kind of emotion on some guy is a precious gift -- unless they think he is the goods).  She wants to see if you fit her screwed up romantic notions of a "true" man she reads in her trashy romance novels. Therefore, she could care less what is "inside".  What she wants is some guy who won't put up with her crap, will not let her always get her way, and keeps her on her toes by making her uncertain as whether she has a strangle hold on her guy; he can walk away at any moment.In otherwords, to keep a woman you must always keep her on her toes, let her wonder about you to fuel a drama she so craves; her world is boring and she yearns to find excitement.  This is the American woman:  stuck up, spoilt with a chip on her shoulder.  With economic independance, she now realizes that she does not need the man to survive. She now has the luxury to simply sit back and say, "Entertain me boys, give me some instant emotional gratification.  Make me feel so I can enjoy chasing you and destroying you."  Notice that everything evolves around her; she cares only how *she* feels, she only cares if *she* is entertained. Where does the guy fit it?  He is only there to make *her* feel. A woman is the *center* of the universe.Now what types of thoughts go through this narcissitic vantage point, where everything revolves around her, what type of wants does she have."Things must be my way.""I am too good for almost anyone.""I need to be worshipped and adored.""I need to be showered with attention."THIS IS YOUR PRINCESS RIGHT HERE.What do you do?  You do the exact opposite."Things must be my way."  You don't let her get her way all the time.  You say it is my way or the highway."I am too good for almost anyone."  You show her that she is not too "good" by *not* treating her like a princess. You appear confident like she is one of a thousand chicks you already have had.  You don't shower her with gifts and tell her how great she is and so on."I need to be worshipped and adored."  You don't make yourself too available.  You don't tell her you love her.  You don't validate everything she does or says.  You treat her as every other person."I need to be showered with attention." You be a challenge to her by showing borderline disinterest. You only go out with her once a week. Now, why by doing the exact opposite to her "wants" (jerk ability) makes her respond?  Why does the "nice" guy that fills her needs falls by the wayside?   BY GOING AGAINST HER WISHES YOU ARE CREATING FRICTION. A WOMAN LOVES FRICTION BECAUSE IT IS THE ESSENCE OF DRAMA.Friction --> Drama --> Excitement --> Emotions --> FeelingsWhat ensues is basically a power struggle.  It is a wrestling match.  What happens is either the guy looses it (starts giving in) or she becomes so wrapped up in the drama that she can't take it anymore (constant stimulation does lead to exhaustion).  Now at this point the woman actually hates the guy because she can't get her way.  The funny thing is that she can't leave him because she is so addicted to the excitement he provides her.  What happens at this stage. The woman responds something like this, "Why do you keep playing games with me.  I want this relationship to work.  I don't think you take me seriously.  Why don't you love me . . . "What has the guy effectively done.  He has torn down the narcisstic image she once had. He has now become her source of pleasure; she needs him. Because of this need, the foucus now turns away from her onto him.  Now she starts thinking these things:"Maybe if I let him do things, he won't be so ready to leave me.""He doesn't treat me like a princess, I wonder maybe I'm not a princess.  Maybe he is better than me.""Maybe if I was kinder and giving, he'll show more affection to me.""I just want his attention. I want him to say he loves me."At this point the woman desperately wants to be validated by a man who has worn her down (won the power struggle).  For the first time in her life she is unsure of herself, of who she is and whether she is truly lovable (she wants to be loved by the guy who made her emotionally respond).  The guy has effectively taken her away from the center of the universe and created a void.  What the woman wants at this stage is for him to fill the void and make her feel she is worthy, lovable and respected.  Mr. Jerk at this point blows the whole thing (by not showing any respect and affection) and she eventually realizes is that he doesn't really care (is to into his own world) that she can't stand having the void not filled.  The right guy at this stage then starts to show affection, love, and true respect and he tells her that she has earned it.  She starts feeling great because she has started to get something from someone she really wanted (woman do honestly wanted to be treated well and loved, we all do) and it did not come easy.  He then goes ahead and fills the void, except this time she is not the center of the universe: he is.  At this point she just wants to make him happy. Here the "nice" guy qualities do come in.Only possibly at this stage, she will then begin to love you for who you are; she will go ahead and want to really see what her prize is made of.  The fact of the matter, is that what is really inside does not count at all in getting a woman, nor making her fall in love with you.  It's sad but true. A woman can simply love you but not for who you are.  This is very disturbing for me.What do you guys think?

    The crook... 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Hey boys,This is the move that will solidify you on early dates.Courting is a ritual. A series of progressions into different stages of a budding relationship. More things go on in the first 4 dates than you realize. Anyways, early on, you are simply there to interview your new date. Elicit what info you can and determine whether or not you want to spend some time getting to know them or just don't want to waste your time with them. Once you realize that you DO want to continue on with them it is your turn to make a move... This magic little ditty will do wonders.When walking from your car to a restaurant or whatever, simply crook you arm(don't look awkward doing it, don't for a second believe she will pass). She will accept the offer as is proper ettiquite whether she's into you or not. By doing this little maneuver you are indicating to everyone else that the two of you are out together. You are indicating to her that you've accepted her as having potential and the evening is going well. You have NOT taken her hand, you have not indicated any level of interest, merely said "I am accepting your company this evening and enjoying it". Pros: A) You come accross as a Gentleman. Manners ARE important.B) She gets to play Audrey Hepburn and feel all American Princessy and warm and fuzzy.(It's all about how you make them FEEL when they are with you)C) You discourage others from eyeing herD) You get some good Kino in.E) You don't come accross as possessive because SHE is holding on to you, not the other way around. In fact, you set the precedent.F) You can deftly move from this position to an arm around the waist.G) She gets to check your pipes out.H) Other women check you out when you have a woman hanging off of you... your date sees this and puts more value on you.I) If she's wearing heels and stumbles she can hang onto you... Women love a sense of security in the man they are out with.J) It shows that you know what you are doing.K) Holding hands early on may be too personal or show too much affection, this is a counterbalance.Cons:A) If she's a femi-nazi you get the I can walk on my own speech.B) If she doesn't take your arm when you offer it is a snub, don't date women who snub you. You are spending your valuable time on showing them a good evening. Snubbing is unacceptable.C) If it's cold and her nose is runny it might drip on your sleeve and dry cleaning is expensive.D) If her most recent ex sees you together he might draw the conclusion that you are closer than you actually are and deduce that she cheated on him with you and decide to make a scene. In which case you have to throw the guy through a store window and everything goes to hell in a handbasket.Yeah, I think it's a magnificent maneuver for a first and second date... even if you're already sleeping together.------------------Your friendly neighbourhood Irishman,Deagleclaw out[This message has been edited by Deagleclaw (edited 11-22-2001).]

Pimpology 101: Connecting Through Understanding and Relating  Part IWomen want to know that you are both able to listen to and understand them. Asking follow up questions, questions that stem from their answers and the current subject of conversation, mostly demonstrates that youve been listening to them but does not show that you fully understand and relate to what theyve said. A strong personal connection cannot be established by simply asking questions, you need to also utilize tactics that make the conversation exciting, dynamic, and unpredictable, while remaining in control at all times. A great way to do this is to employ techniques that demonstrate that you can understand and relate to them.Basic Paraphrasing and Word Substitution:Youve asked about her work:Her: Im a part-time waitress at Dennys.Basic listening:1. Which one?- Since it has multiple locations.2. Wheres it at?- If it were a place you never heard about.3. How long have you been working there?- Youd say something unrelated to its location if it were a place you already knew about.These types of questions are acceptable but all they show are basic listening skills and have a tendency to lead to unoriginal conversation.Both listening and understanding:1. Which Dennys?2. Wheres <name of place> at?3. How long have you been a waitress at <name of place>?In examples 1 and 2, the substitution of a single word is all thats needed to give it a greater psychological effect. Example 3 is slightly different; he not only substitutes a more effective word to refer to the location, but he also adds/substitutes in the word waitress to show that hes relating to her situation. As you can see, paraphrasing can be as easy as incorporating one of her words into whatever you decide to say.Integrating Paraphrasing, Word Substitution, Experience and Preference Relating, and Delayed follow up Questioning:In the next example, the paraphrasing is a little more complex and it uses a combination of word substitution, experience relating, preference relating, and delayed follow-up questioning to further strengthen the connection.Youve asked her what she did last summer:Her: I went to France for a month.You: How was it over in France?Her: I liked it. I visited some of my relatives in Paris.You: I havent been to Paris yet. I wonder if Id like it there (she might interject with youd like it, its nice there)...how often do you visit your relatives over there?1) Words used in Substitution:France, Paris, Visit, Relatives - (demonstrates listening, basic paraphrasing and superficial understanding). 2) Experience Relating:I havent been to Paris yet - (demonstrates listening and understanding)3) Preference Relating:I wonder if Id like it there  - (demonstrates listening and understanding)4) Delayed Follow-Up Questioning:how often do you visit your relatives over there? - (demonstrates basic listening and paraphrasing)The key to this tactic is instead of immediately asking a question related to her answer, you relate with her through experience and/or preference, and then finish the statement with a follow-up question. This provides more depth to the conversation and shows that your conversation skills operate on more than one cylinder. Its also a great way to avoid falling into an interview type of conversation while still demonstrating that you have the skills to pick up on whatever information she decides to give you. NotesIf she were to only say I liked it and not mention that she went to Paris to visit some relatives or anything else, you would still be able to apply the same tactics. You would say, I havent been to France yet. I wonder if Id like it there what things did you do over there?Remember that if the sample situation doesnt apply to you, you can easily switch up a few words. For example, some might have said, I went to Pairs once. It was nice how often do you visit your relatives over there?In sum, not only are these tactics great ingredients for a conversation, they also allow for increased opportunities to incorporate a variety of other conversational techniques that contribute to the overall liveliness.Once you develop the skill to manipulate the conversation in this manner, it wont matter what she says or how much she says initially because youll be able to pick up on and paraphrase anything. Bear in mind that just like many other conversational techniques, the situation has to call for the use of them. Make sure to practice the tactics until you dont have to force the use of any one of them. Once your skills have been polished, you should be able to effortlessly identify the appropriate situations for their use and be able to use the techniques to your advantage.[This message has been edited by Pimpologist (edited 02-04-2002).]

    Pimpology 101: Assumptive Questioning 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Pimpology 101: Assumptive Questioning  Part IWhen talking to women, its a given that asking a majority of open ended questions will inevitably cause them to speak a great deal more than if you were to ask a majority of closed ended questions. The more opportunities they get to speak, the easier it becomes for them to express themselves, both verbally by speaking more and physically by performing kino (physical contact). For those who are unfamiliar with the terms open-ended and closed-ended questions, here is a quick run downOpen-ended:Question that cannot be answered with either yes or noUsual words used to start out the question are who, what, where, when, how, why, etcClosed-ended:Question that can only be answered with either yes or noUsual words used to start out the question are do, can, did, are, have, etcEx.Do you like to <verb>?Can you/your <noun and/or verb>?Did you/your <noun and/or verb>?Are you able to <verb>?Have you ever <verb>?Although open-ended questions usually generate more of a response, it does not always create the desired effect of making them willingly talk more about the subject without an almost equal amount of follow-up questioning on your part.There are times when you ask an open-ended question and you receive a one-word answer, which is of no more help than asking a one-word answer closed-ended question. For example, say you asked her what type of music she likes to listen to and she simply answers with, R&B;. This is equivalent to a closedended question asking her if she liked R&B.; However, if it were used in conjunction with open-ended questions, it would be an effective combo.Using a combination of open and closed ended questionsBoth types of questions have their advantages, so employing a mixture of open-ended and closed-ended questions in your conversations is the best method. Sometimes its best to start out with a closed-ended question in order to lead you into an open-ended one. Heres an exampleYou: Do you like to ski? <---Closed endedHer: YesYou: Whens the last time you went skiing? <---Open endedHer: Last winter. (She also might decide to throw in a few more pieces of information for you to follow up on like where she went, how long she stayed, how often she goes, etc.)Now is a good opportunity for you to experience and/or preference relate and follow-up with either an open or closed-ended question, depending on the direction you want to lead the conversation. Keeping control of the conversation should always be your number one priority.When women answer no to Do you like questions, one of the best open-ended questions to follow-up with is Why not. Theyll usually tell you why but if they answer with I dont know, a good response is something along the lines of, You should try it sometime.As you can see, closed-ended questions are not so bad after all. In some cases, they prove to be very useful. In the above case, the closed-ended question was used to smoothly bring up the topic of skiing. Once rapport on a subject starts to develop, closed-ended questions can be used as filler questions, or as a ways to change the subject. For example if you wanted to change the subject and start asking about her friends, one way you can do it is by asking, Did your friends go with you too? (Closed-ended)Questioning in the form of statements Now that you know the importance and some of the advantages of both open and closed-ended questions, you will be able to appreciate the fact that there is a way to ask a question that is both open and closed ended without actually asking. This is accomplished through the use of Assumptive Questioning.Assumptive questioning is asking questions in the form of statements that imply a variety of questions, both open and closed ended, that not only give you openings to compliment and neg-hit but also give women the chance to talk about what they feel comfortable about. The advantages of letting her decide how she wants to answer your assumptive question is that youre able to find out what she thinks is important to her, what types of questions she prefers answering, what she likes to talk about, and an overall understanding of her personality traits and how she thinks without having to actually ask her. Here are a couple examples of assumptive questioning to get you familiar with the fundamentals of the tactic. These particular examples purposely lead into talking about her body and looks and give you clear opportunities to compliment or neg-hit when shes most vulnerable.Ex. 1)  You: You must like to exercise a lot.Implied Questions:Do you exercise? Do you like to exercise?How often do you exercise?What do you do to keep in shape?Why do you look so good?Ex. 2)You: I bet you like going to the beach.Implied Questions:Do you ever go to the beach? Do you like going to the beach?How do you spend your free time? Where do you like going?Part 1

    Initiating conversation........ 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


There has been a lot of discusssion in the past regarding how to initiate conversation with women.  The question continues to be asked: "How do I approach her?"  A Don Juan here named 'BGC' mentioned his success with the 'say something, anything' approach.  At the time I realized that this was how I have been successful meeting women in the past and successful since then.  I prefer the 'witty, say something, anything' approach over anything else, even the "Hi, I'm DJ de Florida" approach.  No pick-up line, no question, no name introduction.  Just say something.  Here are some examples:1)  You and her are waiting at the check-out desk at your college library.  You see her with a stack of psychology books.  You simply say "I read those last week.  They were so enjoyable I was going to read them again" with a confident smile and sarcastic voice.  Gauge her response and go with it.2) You are walking in the courtyard near your work and see a woman eating a sandwich.  You walk by her and say "chicken, beef, or hummus" with a friendly voice and smile. Gauge her response and go with it.3) You in the mall and see her by herself in the sporting goods store holding a tennis raquet.  You walk by her and say "Remember to give me lessons after winning your first Wimbledon" with a smile.Gauge her response and go with it.    You just have to say something relating to the situation at hand.  Look in her eyes with a smile and say it like you already know her.  ------------------****Don Juan de Florida

    What's past is past 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


There's one of many major things that turns a girl off on a date and that is the guy whining about his past.  Sure, he may have been:- sexually molested by an uncle when he was 8 years,- victimized by schoolyard and workplace bullies,- a pimple faced teenager and didn't go to the senior prom,- a dork with the chicks all his life,- afflicted with low self-esteem,- a poor chooser of a career and a good retirement is out of the question,- an unwise investor and lives from paycheck to paycheck, and_ the list goes on and on.Yes, life has been unkind to you so far and you deserved better, but to spill your lamentations to a girl will greatly lower her interest level in you, even to the point of her not wanting to go out with you again.So, unless you've seeked counselling and received therapy, you better vow to yourself that from today onward, you will view your unfortunate past as water under the bridge and start afresh with an upbeat attitude.  If a chick asks you about your life, just say "Life is simply wonderful", leave it at that and concentrate your attention on her.  She will be impressed with your positive attitude and she'll have a fun time with you.Remember to never bring up your negative past and accentuate the positive.The flip side of the coin is also true.  If a hot babe whines about her rotten life and how people have screwed her so far, her negative attitude tells you that she will be no fun to be with.  You can raise her interest level in you but you cannot change her attitude.[This message has been edited by Take No Dirt (edited 05-12-2002).]

    Porn & Dating Women 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


A Few Words of Advice About Pornography and Dating Single Women My focus this week is on pornography. You need to be aware that a lot of single women are offended by pornography and think it is demeaning to women, causes moral decay, rape, prostitution, etc. So, to be on the safe side early in a relationship with a woman, it would be wise to hide any pornographic photos, magazines, videos, sex toys, etc.  from her. I would advise hiding it in a good place like the attic or locked up in a trunk, file cabinet, etc.  Don't hide it under your mattress or under the bed or in your closet.  You'd be surprised how women will snoop around while you're not looking. So what's the point of all this?  If a girl you're dating is disgusted and offended by porno and she accidently or purposely discovers pornographic materials in your apartment or house, guess what message that sends to her?  She may think that you're some kind of pervert and may be very offended.  Offended to the point that she will not want to date you anymore. So guys, keep your porno out of sight until you get to know a woman better and her viewpoints on pornography, sex toys, etc. If she has nothing against pornography then you don't have to be so discreet.  But, if she is dead set against porno even after you have established a serious relationship, just keep your stuff hidden (you can always break it out when she's not around).

    The smelling works... ooohhh yeahhhh! 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Remember that article by Sisonpyh that BGC posted in the main forum a couple of weeks ago?In this article, the guy mentioned that he's smelling his woman to get her extremely turned on. Well, I field-tested this technique last weekend and it was mighty successful!We (that's me and the girl I'm currently dating) were in bed talking and making out and I just started smelling her hair, face, ears, shoulders and neck (in no particular order) while giving away signs that I was really enjoying it ("mmmmm"). Every time I inhaled, I slowly exhaled on the same body part I was smelling but didn't otherwise touch her. She seemed to like it a lot so I repeated the process for 10 minutes or so: *sniff*, "mmmmm", *blow*, "ahhhh" (from her) and then whispered in her ear: "mmmm... you smell so good". She: "what do I smell like?"So I smelled her a little more and said: "hmmm... (pause... *sniff*) like a cake... (pause... *sniff sniff*) fresh out of the oven".She really liked that comparison so I said: "it's so good that I know that eventually I won't be able to hold myself and I'll just have to eat you" (get the hint? She most definitely did  ).Then I continued smelling her, moving down her body and back up to her face for another 10 minutes or so. Then I started to get creative...I started smelling her again, but this time I lightly touched her skin with my nose. Then I slowly liberated her from her night gawn and panties using only my mouth (okay... she helped a little... but just a little), all the time smelling her and blowing softly on her skin. By the time I was ready to start eating she was already squirming...Then I nestled myself comfortably between her legs and started giving that same *sniff* "mmmmm" *blow* "ahhhh" treatment to her fanny, adding the occasional lick / kiss / what have you.After 5 minutes or so of this, when the words that came from her mouth stopped making sense, I started really eating her out and touching the rest of her body. Soon after, she suddenly sat up, looked straight into my eyes and said: "I want you. Now!". I think I could've stretched it a little longer but the girl seemed to be genuinely suffering so I had to comply and give in  . Now... DJs, that was BY FAR the best sexual experience I've ever had (and believe me, I've had a few) and judging from her reactions throughout (notable ones include: "nnnnngggggg", "mmmmrrrrgggggghhhh" and "bffffmmmmnnnnghhh") I'd say she had at least as much fun as I did.So... what can I say. Smell 'em, baby and there will be joy!K.------------------"Learn the rules so you know how to break them properly" - The Dalai Lama.

Hey boys,Women aren't looking for mediocre.  They're looking for someone who can GET THEM OFF.  They're looking for someone who knows what they are doing.  They are looking for someone who will f*ck their brains out.  The best way to become great in bed is to practice... with someone more experienced than you.  That's right.  Cougars.

The more you learn, the more women will want to sleep with YOU!It's that simple... besides, cougars are pretty easy to score with.  They know the game.  They know the objective.  And unlike college girls, they've given up that pretensious girly crap...  they know what they want and they take it by storm.Deagleclaw out------------------No matter what comes, walk like a man.  - Al Lan Mandragoran (Wheel of Time)

Most of what you have read in the Forums deals with "How to get women" and how to deal with the first few dates and the STR's. But when it comes to an LTR, the forums leave something to be desired. So, for all you experienced DJ's thinking about the next step up - this one is for you.1 - The POINT Of The LTR?An LTR is a relationship between a guy and a girl that is based around strong mutual attraction on the physical, mental, and possibly even spiritual levels. It involves the concept of "love" and the desire to be with someone you care very highly about for a long time - possibly for the whole of your lives. It is NOT something to jump into lightly, but it can have very rewarding aspects to it and (if you choose your partner wisely) will lead you to a level of contentment unlike you have ever experienced before.2 - The Principles change in an LTR.The first thing you have to realise about an LTR is that the rules have changed slightly. A successful LTR involves far much more than portraying an aura of confidence and being a challenge. The thing that makes an LTR what it is, is the fact that it is LONG TERM. You are thinking about spending an amount of time with a woman that can be measured in years and possibly even decades (gulp). Think about this for a minute here - do you really expect to last in a relationship for several years (at least) with a woman who's only positive aspects include being attractive and good in bed? That might have worked in the short-term for you, but that just isn't LTR material. If you think otherwise, then an LTR is not in your best interests.The DJ principles that normally apply to women still stand in the LTR. However, things are going to be different. This is because the MAIN factor involved in successful LTR's is compatible personalities between you and the woman you're after. That's right - the two of you have to be able to stand eachother enough to WANT

    How to keep a gal 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Once you have gotten over the hump by getting her home telephone number, set up the initial date and have dated her a few times, there's that nagging question in the DJ's mind: how do you keep the gal?  Some DJs have said "Keeping her was more difficult than getting her".  So, what are the various ways of improving your chances that she'll stay with you.First off, we know that females are emotional creatures (males on the other hand are visual species).  Women must be emotionally stimulated, otherwise, they'll become bored, restless and will seek some other dude who can provide that stimuli.  I offer the following for your consideration:* Give her a sense of impending finality, i.e., you may be on the verge of moving on to another gal.  Let her think she's one of many chicks in your life. She'll compete to keep you to herself.  She enjoys the challenge.* Whenever you're with her, look at your watch every so often.  She'll think that you have other plans on the burner.  Act like a thoroughbred horse who's champing at the bit to get out of the starting gate.* Show her your almost uncontrollable exuberance about life.  Flash her that Steinway piano keys smile of yours.  Make your eyes sparkle with excitement.* Whistle a tune in her presence.  That way, you're giving off the signal that life is simply peachy.* Dress the best you possibly can afford. Your clothes must be impeccable.  She will feel the excitement in you just like she felt on her high school graduation day.* Tease and flirt with her like crazy.  Get her to the point where she almost has to take a leak because you're cracking her up so much.* See her sparingly but the time you spend with her, make it super quality time.  Time the activities with a drill sergeant's precision.  Make her breathless as you go from one event to another.* Project nothing but positive comments when talking to her.  She must identify you with "joie de vive".* It's OK to disagree with her and even get mad at her.  This gives a roller coaster effect, i.e., from her feeling high one minute to her crashing down to earth.  Make up to her with some super sex.* Concerning sex, don't be predictable.  Go for some role playing and fantasy.  Slow almost excruciating foreplay is paramount.  Tease her mind (a woman's most erotic sexual organ) and get her to literally beg you to fu*k her like a sl*t.  She must be kept guessing as to what the next sexual adventure will be like.[This message has been edited by Take No Dirt (edited 01-25-2002).]

    A long post about long
    </h3>
    <p>
    


Before you read any further:We all want to get the girls, no point arguing about that, but we all have different reasons. Some of us are looking for sex with no strings attached. Some of us are looking for something "serious" but for a short term and some of us are looking for a long-term commitment, even (gasp) marriage. If you belong to the first two groups, then this post is probably not for you, but if you belong to that third group (or think you'll eventually belong to it) I think you will find it interesting.Let's take a minute to fantasize about the perfect committed relationship: having a relationship like that means that you have a companion. Someone you can trust. Someone you can completely open up to and get to know better than anyone else. Someone who will stick by your side for better and for worse, through thick and thin, forever. Someone you can love.Now let's go back to reality and try to figure out how we can find this perfect someone.As with everything else in life, a good place to start is trying to figure out what it is exactly that you want. Don't be afraid to be specific. On the contrary, be as specific and picky as you possibly can. Telling yourself that your ideal mate is a brunette with straight, shoulder-length hair, brown eyes, slim figure, about 5'7", 115 pounds, small butt, C cup chest, who is a part time novelist, part time veterinary doctor who lives in a small house in the suburbs, drives a Honda, owns a brownish-gold Labrador Retriever named Sparky and spends her spare time playing the Cello is far better than thinking: "hmmm a blond would be kinda nice". By having a pretty good idea of what you're looking for, you will have better chances to actually find it. Now that you know what you're looking for, it's time to start looking. I'm not going to discuss this process in detail as it is continuously being discussed in this community  . Suffice it to say that this step is mandatory and you should have enough confidence to pursue every woman that strikes your fancy. If you don't make the effort to find what you're looking for, you will never find what you're looking for. Simple, cruel and very true. Ms. Rights do not tend to fall from the stars straight into your arms.Once you found someone that seems to match this incredibly picky profile of yours, it's time to start the most important step  qualification. People are complicated beings. Part of what makes them so complicated is what we call their "personality". A  "personality", according to Meriam-Webster, is "the totality of an individual's behavioral and emotional characteristics".  Each person has hundreds (or thousands) of these "characteristics" and the combination of them is what makes this person unique. Now, when you're looking for a long-term relationship, compatible personalities are probably the number one issue. But with so many characteristics involved in shaping one's personality, how can you really tell what's compatible and what isn't? Well, I actually have an easy way for you (you lucky bastard). You need to make two lists (in your mind or in your notebook): The first one should include positive traits that you absolutely require and even more importantly, negative traits you will not tolerate under any circumstances. We'll call this list the Requirements List. The second list should include positive traits that are important to you but are not mandatory, as well as quirks you can live with. We'll call this second list the Bonus List. Now, you should have a pretty good idea of what your Requirements List includes even before you go looking for someone. The Bonus List really comes into play once you meet a person that seems to have passed your requirements. These lists are not written in stone either. They should be modified as you get to meet and qualify (or disqualify) more people. Having these two lists makes it relatively easy to judge whether the woman you're dating is "relationship material" or not. When you make your final judgment or qualification you have to abide by one simple rule: you should never compromise on your Requirements List! If you do, then sooner or later your relationship will explode, causing pain to you, your partner and anyone else involved in your relationship (can you say children?). Compromises should be limited only to things on your Bonus List. After you've found your perfect match, the next step is to spend a long time together with her to prove that your perfect compatibility is not a fluke. By "long time" I mean exactly that. A very long time! A couple of years! The reason is simple: if you're in for a long ride anyway, you may as well delay the really big commitments (the ring, kids, buying a house together, etc.) until you're absolutely sure she is indeed "the one", rather than rush things and get burned. This approach will also address another serious issue  the "should I stop looking?" issue. If you spend a couple of years with one woman and doesn't feel the need to continue looking, then I'd say you're ready. Now, in a perfect world, everything I wrote here would probably be true. Sadly, however, this world is not perfect. People change. You might find the perfect woman who matches you initial profile, complies with every requirement on your Requirements List and have most of the things on your Bonus List, get married, have kids and after 10 years find out that the two of you are no longer compatible. I'm sorry to tell you that I don't really have an answer to that. The only thing you can do to minimize the chances that this will happen to you is to take things very slowly and one step at a time. Making a commitment is something very serious that should not be taken lightly. There are too many divorces and too many single-parented families in America today as a result of people "rushing" into commitment. Take your time and you will have better chances to be successful.Thank you for reading this long post. As usual, your comments are welcome.K. ------------------If at first you don't succeed, don't let anybody know you've even tried - unknown.

    <h3>
    The Natural Progression of a Relationship 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


1)Interest and Attraction...this is where two people initially see or meet each other and decide they both want to get to know each other better.2)Infatuation and Falling in Love...this is the stage where you become blinded by your emotions and often times behave like a love sick puppy dog.  The attention and mushiness of the other person makes you feel really great about yourself and you begin to fall "in love"...this is all about how YOU feel about yourself because of the other person.  IT is NOT love.  It is that thing that reduces you to a slobbering fool who speaks in "baby talk".3) The Comfort Zone...this is where you start to relax, and move out of the infatuation stage into something more "real".  This is also the time where feelings begin to deepen towards the other person while experiencing a reduced feeling of being "in love".  After being in this stage for awhile many people make the mistake of thinking the relationship is in trouble because they aren't still infatuated. In reality, the relationship is beginning to grow into Mature Love.  So many people bail at this point and never actually reach the "Love" stage.4) Mature Love...this is the real deal, folks.  You have reached the point of having a genuinely mature relationship, that, if you have chosen the right partner, is a beautiful thing.  Reaching Stage 4 doesn't mean the fun is all over, though.  You can and will go from stage to stage at different times throughout the relationship.  You can even learn to do things that will make you and your partner feel infatuated and falling in love all over again.Most relationships are either made or broken during the Comfort Zone.  That is the most important time to really work your DJ skills in a relationship so your partner doesn't bail.

    Compatibility in an LTR 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


For most DJs, sooner or later, they're going to consider an LTR.  In a short term relationship, physical attraction is all that matters; if her attitude stinks or if she's clingy, you can easily NEXT her.In an LTR, a DJ has to determine if the chick he's considering marrying and becoming the mother of his kids is not only a hot babe physically, but also an intelligent woman who can stimulate him intellectually.If the DJ has a bachelor's degree, can he marry a high school graduate who's only interested in eating bonbons and watching Oprah Winfrey and the Young and the Restless?  Rest assured that the sex may be great and she still has a high Interest Level in the DJ, but the sex will level off and then what's there to keep the relationship/marriage going for decades?It's stimulating conversations that will keep the embers of an LTR burning strongly.  Being able to converse with your wife who went to university, earned her degree and kept herself up-to-date with current events and has made educating herself a lifetime affair will energize your LTR and keep you intellectually challenged.Consider strongly the gal's penchant for higher education and continued learning before you ask her hand in marriage.  There's more to an LTR than great sex.  Compatibility is a bigger issue.  Are you two compatible on an intellectual plateau?  That hot cocktail waitress who dropped out of high school and that single mom with 2 kids from a relationship with a jerk with a Grade 6 education whom you are both dating, are they LTR material?

    <h3>
    An Important Part of a LTR: Friendship 
    </h3>
    <p>
    


TND's post about compatibility prompted me to post some more LTR advice for anyone who needs it.My first tips post... how exciting! my ideas be torn to shreds by many DJ's because I am a woman? Only time will tell...A Different Kind of Friendzone This is a post for all of your who are in a relationship that is moving toward a long-term relationship (LTR) or already in a LTR or marriage. We talk about the friendzone when you first meet someone  that non-sexual, brother/sister-like place where it is hard to move to dating or romance from. You dont want to get into that because it is difficult to get out of. But, there is a different kind of friendzone that you want  to be in once you move into a serious LTR, because it is the only way that LTR is going to remain happy and last. Some people have the idea that a relationship is going to be all flowers and dinners and romantic walks in the rain. Or passionate hot sex, steamy vacations and exciting dates. In reality, these things are not what a relationship is all about. Dont get me wrong, you will have these things in a good relationship  and plenty of them. But, what makes up most of day to day of life, and hence most of a relationship, is the ordinary. Sleeping, waking up, getting dressed, paying the bills, taking out the trash, cooking dinner, sitting around the dinner table, talking, vacuuming, eating, etc. Now think about your friends  your best friends. The people that you know well and who are your allies, supporters, and sympathizers. You accept them for who they are, you would do almost anything for them and you derive pleasure from simply chilling with them. Because you love who they are, you enjoy talking to them and simply being with them. Since you find them interesting to just talk to and be with, you can spend an evening sitting around, drinking beer and playing cards and have a great time. This is what companionship is all about. To have this in a relationship, you have to be more than just "boyfriend and girlfriend" or lovers, you have to actually be friends. You have to be comfortable enough to lay around in sweatpants on a Sunday morning eating cereal in bed and enjoy doing it. Researchers who study couples and what makes or breaks them, say the best marriages harmonize. It is the constant reassurance, both verbal and in actions, that let their partner know that they are loved and accepted despite minor differences or minor problems. This is exactly how you treat a good friend if you want to be a good friend to them. When you are in a good LTR, a true friendship must be a central part of your relationship. Obviously, friendship cannot be the entire relationship, because then you would just be friends. But, it must be a primary component of how you and your partner relate to each other. In a good relationship, there should be thrills, romance, excitement, intellectual conversations, tingling sensations, crazy sex, wild passion and deep desire. These are things that should frequently flavor everyday life, but dont define it. In the end, if you do not enjoy the simple mundane with your partner, the relationship is doomed to failure.
